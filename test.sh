#
# `all` means all four PostgreSQL VERSIONS, not all tracks. The timescale, observe, archive, perf,
# discriminate, locktrace and lockview tracks each need their own image or service, so `./test.sh all` deliberately skips them
# and a green run of it does NOT mean CI will be green. That gap is real: a change to
# pgpm_core/install.sql broke the archive track's fixture while `./test.sh all` stayed green from end
# to end, and only the PR's archive job caught it. Use `./test.sh ci` before pushing anything that
# touches pgpm_core, which every one of these tracks installs.
#
# Channels:
#   psql    pgpm_core/install.sql via psql -f         (the source)
#   bundle  scripts/build_install_bundle.sh output            (dashboard SQL editor)
#   dbdev   scripts/build_dbdev_package.sh output (minified)  (dbdev / TLE / CREATE EXTENSION)
#
# The `timescale` track is a separate invocation (it needs TimescaleDB on its own image and is PG15-only, so
# `./test.sh` with no args does not run it), but CI's default Test Suite calls it on every push/PR via the
# reusable .github/workflows/timescale.yml. It exercises pgpm.from_hypertable against real hypertables
# (tests/timescale/).
#
# The `observe` track is also separate: pgpm_core ships pg_flight_recorder (PGFR) correlation functions
# (observe_window/impact_report) that are always present but only do anything
# useful with PGFR installed (the PGFR-absent gate is a plain test in the main suite,
# tests/65_observe_no_pgfr_test.sql). This track installs the vendored PGFR and asserts the
# impact_report correlation against its telemetry (tests/observe/). PGFR is
# vendored under bench/vendor/ and needs only pg_cron, so the track runs on the stock pgpm_test:15 image.
#
# The `archive` track is also separate: it installs the OPTIONAL pgpm_archive module on top of the
# core and exercises it against a real MinIO container standing in for S3 (tests/archive/). Its own
# image (pgpm_test:17-archive) adds pgsql-http on top of the stock pg17 image. Like the default matrix,
# it runs every tests/archive/db/*.sql via pg_prove in ONE DATABASE PER FILE, each one cloned from a
# template (pgpm_arch_tmpl) that carries the fixtures and both modules. These files used to isolate
# themselves with BEGIN/ROLLBACK against one shared database, which stopped being possible once the
# fixture's pgpm.transmute became a committing PROCEDURE (#275): transaction control is illegal inside
# an explicit transaction block. Cloning gives back the isolation the rollback provided, and gives it
# for real, since a rollback never undid anything these tests pushed to MinIO. After the pgTAP
# suite, it also runs scripts/verify_parquet.py/verify_parquet_range.py (a venv-installed Python
# step, not psql) against the same running instance: independent-reader (pyarrow + DuckDB)
# verification of archive._pq_to_parquet/_range, ported into this repo proper from a standalone
# prototype (prototypes/parquet-writer/, removed) once that prototype's code was fully absorbed
# into pgpm_archive/install.sql.
# It is a standalone, path-filtered CI workflow (like `observe`'s), not wired into the default Test
# Suite or the release gate.

# Wait for the REAL server, over TCP (#317).
#
# The postgres entrypoint starts a TEMPORARY init server to run its init scripts, then shuts it down and
# starts the real one. That temporary server listens on the UNIX SOCKET ONLY. So a socket probe can
# succeed against it and hand back a connection that dies moments later -- the next command fails with
# `No such file or directory` on the socket, or `the database system is shutting down`, one or two
# seconds after compose reported the container Started. A TCP probe cannot see the init server at all, so
# it succeeds only once the real one is accepting connections.
#
# The timescale track hit this first and fixed it there (supabase/postgres's heavier init widens the
# window). The matrix and the observe/archive tracks raced it too, just rarely enough to look like bad
# luck: it surfaced as one PG17 job of four failing while the other three passed the same commit.
#
# `up -d --wait` is NOT the fix, which is why it is not used here: the compose healthcheck is
# `pg_isready -U postgres`, which also goes over the socket and so is satisfied by the very init server
# this is trying to see past.
#
# Fails LOUDLY on exhaustion. The loops this replaces fell through to the first real command, which then
# reported the same confusing connection error -- so a genuinely dead container looked identical to a
# slow one, and the log pointed at the wrong statement.

# it for the next catalog return to steal.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL, given the renderer gates no merge and its design spec listed "No CI job"
# among its non-goals. That reasoning holds for the figure and not for the probe. Nothing ships on
# the figure, but an instrument that fabricates a grant tells its reader the confident opposite of
# the truth, and until this track there was nothing between a simplification of those twenty lines
# of BPF C and the defect coming back. The spec's Non-goals section has been amended with this
# reasoning rather than silently contradicted.
#
# Steps 3 and 4 were added after the track first shipped, and the gap they close is worth naming:
# both demos were ALREADY in this workflow's path filter, so editing either one FIRED this job,
# which then went green having never executed the file that changed. That is worse than no gate at
# all -- an absent check is visibly absent, while a green one that ran nothing reads as assurance.
# Every demo named in the filter is now actually run by the track.
#
# FOUR STEPS, and they cover different failures:
#
#   1. bench/lock_view.sh end to end over a real maintain_all() tick. Covers attach, in-kernel
#      filtering, the name snapshots and the format contract. These failures are already loud on
#      their own (an attach error is fatal and named, a missing catalog filter shows up as tens of
#      thousands of events, a malformed capture is refused outright by plot_lock_view.py), so this
#      step's value is running the whole pipeline the way a human actually would, not novel coverage.
#   2. bench/lock_timeout_pairing_demo.sh. THIS is the step that gates the silent defect, and the
#      only step here that would have caught it: the fabricated grant reported
#      {"dropped": 0, "unmatched": 0}, loaded cleanly through the consumer, and was refused by
#      nothing. Measured against a hand-reverted probe (the mutation the demo's own header
#      describes): 2 lock events instead of 1, a fabricated wait_ns of 100541273 against a 100 ms
#      lock_timeout, and unmatched 0 instead of 1 -- three of its six checks flip, while BOTH its
#      liveness witnesses stay green, so the failure is attributable to the defect rather than to a
#      fixture that quietly did nothing.
#   3. bench/lock_view_prefix_demo.sh. Gates the enlistment primer. lock_view.py enlists a backend
#      only on its FIRST touch of a target oid, so a lock that same backend took earlier in the
#      traced statement is invisible, and a truncated prefix renders as a complete sequence with no
#      refusal anywhere to catch it. It needs no mutation because it is self-discriminating by
#      construction: its case 1 runs UNPRIMED and REQUIRES the defect to reproduce against the
#      unmodified probe, so the two cases cannot both pass unless the primer is what made the
#      difference.
#   4. bench/lock_view_names_scope_demo.sh. Gates the schema-scoped managed_parent join in
#      bench/sql/lockview_names.sql: two managed parents sharing a bare relname in different schemas
#      used to fold their children onto whichever parent's row happened to read last,
#      nondeterministically. The one step here needing no eBPF -- it is a plain SQL correctness
#      check -- but it belongs in THIS track regardless, because this is the track whose path filter
#      fires when that query changes. Measured against the join reverted to bare-name-only: both
#      row-count checks go to "got 2, want 1".
#
# THE FIXTURE has to survive plot_lock_view.py's `strong` refusal, which rejects any capture carrying
# no ShareRowExclusive/Exclusive/AccessExclusive mark, on the grounds that "a tick that did nothing
# renders as a calm, correct-looking figure". So it is built to make the MEASURED tick actually drop
# a partition: retain's DROP takes ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on the parent, and that is the strong mark. This
# is deliberate, not incidental -- a fixture with nothing to do would make this track fail on its own
# setup, which is the failure shape hardest to tell apart from a real defect.
