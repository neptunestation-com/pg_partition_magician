## Concepts

**What it manages.** pg_partition_magician transmutes an existing, unpartitioned table into a native
`RANGE`-partitioned table and then keeps it healthy: it creates future partitions ahead of your writes,
optionally splits the historical bulk into proper partitions on a schedule, and drops partitions past
your retention policy. Everything is pure SQL in the `pgpm` schema; the only runtime dependency is
`pg_cron`, and only to run the background job.

**Control kinds.** A table is partitioned on one monotonic key, of one of four kinds:

- `time`: a `timestamptz` / `timestamp` / `date` column, on an interval grid (calendar-aligned for whole
  months/years, fixed-duration otherwise). Transmute with `pgpm.transmute(..., interval '...')`.
- `id`: an `int` / `bigint` / `numeric` column, on an integer step. Covers Snowflake-style ids. Transmute
  with `pgpm.transmute(..., <bigint step>)`.
- `uuidv7`: a `uuid` column holding time-ordered UUIDv7 (or ULID-as-uuid) values, on a time grid with
  uuid-encoded bounds. A `uuid` control column is *treated as* this kind. PostgreSQL has no UUIDv7 type
  and v7-ness is not detectable from the catalog, so pgpm *assumes* a `uuid` control column is
  time-ordered and samples it ([`check_uuidv7`](reference.md#check_uuidv7)) to gate the conversion: a
  column that samples as overwhelmingly random (UUIDv4) is refused. Pass `p_force_uuidv7 => true` to
  override if you are certain it is time-ordered.
- `text_time`: a `text` / `varchar` column holding an opaque id shaped `<constant prefix><fixed-width
  base-N encoded value>`. For cuid and ULID that value *is* the timestamp; for KSUID it's the top bits
  of a wider one (KSUID base62-encodes its whole 160-bit payload as a single number, against a non-Unix
  epoch). The shape is *declared*, not detected: `p_tt_prefix`/`p_tt_width`/`p_tt_radix`/`p_tt_unit` on
  `transmute`, plus `p_tt_alphabet` for a digit set other than the default `0-9a-z` (ULID's Crockford
  base32, KSUID's base62 both need it) and `p_tt_discard_bits`/`p_tt_epoch` for the KSUID case. Ready-to-use
  values for cuid v1, ULID, KSUID and MongoDB ObjectId are in [Pick the kind](#pick-the-kind) below --
  verified against each format's own source, not guessed from its name. pgpm samples the column against
  the declared shape ([`check_text_time`](reference.md#check_text_time)) to gate the conversion, the
  same way `check_uuidv7` does; `p_force_text_time => true` overrides.

`float` / `double` are rejected: they cannot guarantee gapless boundaries and `NaN`/`Inf` poison the
ordering. A `numeric` `id` column is accepted, but `transmute` refuses one that holds `NaN`,
`Infinity` or `-Infinity`: no partition can hold such a row, so delete or correct it and re-run. An encoding whose alphabet order does not match its digit-value order (so plain text comparison
would not reflect time order), or whose timestamp field is not a fixed width, does not fit `text_time`;
partition on a companion column instead.

**The frontier.** For `time` the frontier is `now()`; for `id` it is `max(control)`, the newest point
the data has reached. `uuidv7` and `text_time` are time grids fed by data: their frontier is
`greatest(max(control), now())`, so it tracks the newest row while writes are current and falls
back to the clock when they lag, rather than freezing wherever the data last landed. A `text_time` maximum
that does not have the declared shape (a digit outside the alphabet, or a timestamp field shorter than the
width) cannot be decoded, and the frontier is then `now()` alone, so one malformed id does not stop the grid
from growing; `check_text_time` reports such a maximum as a null `newest_decoded`. An interval is "open" while the frontier
is inside it (still receiving writes) and "closed" once the frontier moves past its upper bound.

**The monolith.** Conversion moves **no rows**. It renames your original table aside and attaches it,
intact, as one bounded **coarse child** -- the *monolith* -- covering `[grid_floor(min), B)`, where `B` is
the grid boundary just above the frontier. So immediately after transmute the whole history lives in one
correct, fully-queryable partition, and the table is partitioned in form. The monolith doubles as the
current partition until the frontier crosses `B`, then it freezes.

**There is no DEFAULT partition.** Alongside the monolith, transmute builds a *forward grid*: real,
bounded partitions running `config.obtain` steps ahead of the write frontier. A write that no partition
covers is **refused**, not parked:

```text
ERROR:  no partition of relation "events" found for row
```

That is deliberate: a refused write is loud and immediate, where a `DEFAULT` would absorb it silently and
leave you a backlog to discover later. The trade is that `config.obtain x partition_step` is both your
slack if maintenance stalls and a ceiling on how far ahead you may write, so size it for your grid:
30 steps is a month on a daily one.

**The lifecycle (what maintenance does).** Two scheduled procedures drive these per table:
`pgpm.maintain_obtain_all()` runs obtain, on its own cadence so a slow step elsewhere never delays it;
`pgpm.maintain_all()` runs the rest:

- **obtain**: create up to N partitions ahead of the frontier, so live writes always land in a real
  partition. Pure catalog work: there is no `DEFAULT` to scan, so nothing is proven and nothing is moved.
  This is also pgpm's *only* protection against a write with nowhere to go, since a row outside the grid
  is refused rather than parked. `config.obtain x partition_step` is therefore both your slack if
  maintenance stalls and a ceiling on how far ahead you may write. `pgpm.extend_to(parent, value)` is the
  manual escape hatch when a write is going to land beyond that ceiling on purpose (see
  [Extend the grid past the lookahead ceiling](#extend-the-grid-past-the-lookahead-ceiling)).
- **retain**: drop partitions older than your policy.
- **regrain** (optional): split the coarse monolith into finer partitions, on demand or paced across ticks.

**Regrain is the bulk mover.** The historical bulk sits in the monolith until you *regrain* it into
properly-sized partitions, by copying (never deleting) so there are no dead tuples and no vacuum. You can
regrain by hand, enable a paced auto-regrain, or never regrain at all -- a coarse monolith is a correct,
permanent terminal state; you only lose partition pruning and fine-grained retention over its span until
it is split. See [Regrain the history](#regrain-the-history).

## Install

`pgpm_core/install.sql` is the single source of truth: pure, idempotent SQL with no psql
metacommands. It ships through three channels, all built from that one file.

The simplest path, on any Postgres you can run SQL against:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --single-transaction -f pgpm_core/install.sql
```

Keep both flags, for an install and for every upgrade. Without `ON_ERROR_STOP` psql reports an error and
carries on with the rest of the file, so a run that fails or refuses partway still executes everything
after it and appends a row to `pgpm.installed` as if it had completed. `--single-transaction` runs the
file as one transaction (it has no top-level `COMMIT`; the commits inside its procedures run only when
those procedures are called), so a run that stops changes nothing at all. The cost is that each lock an
upgrade takes is held until the whole file commits, not just until its own statement ends.

For a SQL client that does not process psql metacommands (a dashboard editor, say), build a
self-contained `BEGIN/COMMIT`-wrapped bundle and paste it in:

```bash
scripts/build_install_bundle.sh pgpm_core/install.sql dist/pg_partition_magician-bundle.sql
```

On a managed Postgres with `pg_tle`, it can also be installed as a Trusted Language Extension from
[database.dev](https://database.dev) (the `psql -f` path above is simpler and recommended):

```sql
select dbdev.install('dventimisupabase@pg_partition_magician');
create extension "dventimisupabase@pg_partition_magician" version '0.6.0' cascade;
```

You also need `pg_cron` enabled to run scheduled maintenance.

**Upgrade** by re-running the same file. Your views over pgpm's functions (`status()`, `progress()`,
`observe_window()`, `check_uuidv7()`, `check_text_time()`) survive it: a function whose shape is unchanged is
replaced in place. When an upgrade changes one's result or arguments and a view of yours depends on it, the
run refuses before it has changed anything, naming the function and the view (SQLSTATE `2BP01`), and the
flags above make that refusal stop the run. Save the view's definition
(`select pg_get_viewdef('<view>'::regclass, true)`), drop it, re-run the file, then recreate the view
against the new shape.

**Uninstall** removes the manager and leaves your data. Gone: the `pgpm` schema (configuration,
registry, log, every function and view), its cron jobs, the write-block triggers on frozen children, and
regrain's change capture, which lives in your schema rather than in `pgpm`: a `<table>_pgpm_regrain_delta`
table, a `<table>_pgpm_regrain_capture()` trigger function (`pgpm_regrain_delta_<oid>` and
`pgpm_regrain_capture_<oid>()` for a table name too long for those), and the `pgpm_regrain_capture` trigger on a
child being regrained. A regrain still in flight is abandoned first, as `pgpm.regrain_cancel` would: its
not-yet-attached copies are dropped (the table being regrained still holds every row). Also gone:
`from_hypertable`'s change capture from a `from_hypertable_copy(..., p_track_changes => true)` that was
never cut over (the `<table>_pgpm_delta` table, the `<table>_pgpm_delta_fn()` function and the
`<table>_pgpm_delta_trg` trigger on the live hypertable and its chunks), found by the record the copy keeps
on its delta table, so a table of yours that merely shares the name is left alone. And the copy itself
from any `from_hypertable_copy` never cut over: the `<table>_pgpm_dest` table (a full second copy of the
hypertable's rows) with its indexes and the foreign keys it holds, found by the record the copy keeps on
it, and dropped while the hypertable it was copied from still exists, since that still holds every row.
The copy, the delta and the function are found by oid, so one you renamed or moved since is still found.
Left: every transmuted table, still a partitioned table under its original name, with all of its
partitions and rows. Nothing else pgpm made remains in your schema, with one exception that a `WARNING`
names: a never-cut-over copy whose hypertable you have since dropped, because it may hold the only copy
of those rows. A copy made by 0.6.0 or earlier carries no record; drop it yourself.

Uninstall also puts back every incoming foreign key that `transmute(..., p_incoming_fks => 'preserve')`
dropped and pgpm has not restored yet (a paused table's keys wait for a maintenance tick that never
comes), the same way a tick would: `NOT VALID`, so it enforces every new write, and a `WARNING` gives the
`validate constraint` statement for each key still unvalidated, since nothing runs it once pgpm is gone.
pgpm holds the only record of such a key, so while any of them cannot be put back (an orphan row written
while it was off, on a table Postgres only re-adds it to validating) uninstall **refuses** and removes
nothing. The error gives each key's `alter table ... add constraint` statement and why it failed. Clear
the cause and run it again, or add the key yourself, or accept losing it with
`delete from pgpm.dropped_fk where constraint_name = '...'`, then run it again. The statement names the
table as it was named when the key was dropped, so if you have moved or renamed the table since, point it
at the table's current name when you add the key yourself. A key you add counts only if it is that key: on
the same table, under the same name, against the managed table. One that merely takes the name, against
another table, does not, and uninstall goes on refusing.

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" --single-transaction -f pgpm_core/uninstall.sql
```

The one thing uninstall cannot undo is a conversion interrupted between `transmute`'s phases, whose
bound `CHECK` goes on rejecting writes outside the recorded range (see
[The cutover moves no rows](#the-cutover-moves-no-rows)). Run
`select pgpm.transmute_abort('public.events')` on any such table first: uninstall removes the record that
would otherwise tell you it is there.

## Transmute a table

Conversion moves no data. It renames your table to a coarse-child name, creates a partitioned parent
under the original name, attaches the old table as the bounded **monolith** child, and lays down the
forward grid above it. It does read the original once, but not under a lock that blocks you; see
[The cutover moves no rows](#the-cutover-moves-no-rows).

### Pick the kind

There is one `pgpm.transmute`, with two type-safe overloads chosen by the width parameter: an `interval`
selects the time grid, a `bigint` step selects the integer grid. Within the time grid, a `uuid` control
column is treated as `uuidv7`, a `text`/`varchar` column as `text_time` (needing `p_tt_prefix` etc., see
above), and a timestamp column as plain `time`. A bare interval string literal is
ambiguous between the overloads, so interval calls must cast (`interval '...'`); an integer width needs no
cast.

```sql
-- time (timestamp/timestamptz/date control column)
call pgpm.transmute('public.events', 'created_at', interval '1 month');

-- id (bigint/numeric), 10M ids per partition
call pgpm.transmute('public.events', 'id', 10000000);

-- uuidv7 / ULID-as-uuid (a uuid control column is treated as this kind)
call pgpm.transmute('public.events', 'event_uuid', interval '1 day');

-- text_time (a text/varchar control column needs the shape spelled out -- four verified recipes)

-- cuid v1 (Prisma's bare cuid()): prefix 'c', 8 base36 digits, milliseconds
call pgpm.transmute('public.events', 'id', interval '1 month',
  p_tt_prefix => 'c', p_tt_width => 8, p_tt_radix => 36, p_tt_unit => 'ms');

-- ULID-as-text: no prefix, 10 digits in Crockford's base32 (skips I/L/O/U), milliseconds
call pgpm.transmute('public.events', 'id', interval '1 month',
  p_tt_prefix => '', p_tt_width => 10, p_tt_radix => 32, p_tt_unit => 'ms',
  p_tt_alphabet => '0123456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ');

-- KSUID: no prefix, all 27 base62 digits (it encodes its whole 160-bit payload as one number, not
-- just the timestamp), seconds, a custom epoch, and discard the low 128 bits to keep only the top 32.
-- The column must be COLLATE "C" (see below): base62 is mixed-case, and en_US does not order it.
call pgpm.transmute('public.events', 'id', interval '1 month',
  p_tt_prefix => '', p_tt_width => 27, p_tt_radix => 62, p_tt_unit => 's',
  p_tt_alphabet => '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz',
  p_tt_discard_bits => 128, p_tt_epoch => '2014-05-13 16:53:20+00');

-- MongoDB ObjectId: no prefix, 8 hex digits, seconds (the default alphabet already covers hex)
call pgpm.transmute('public.events', 'id', interval '1 month',
  p_tt_prefix => '', p_tt_width => 8, p_tt_radix => 16, p_tt_unit => 's');
```

Every value above was verified against the format's own source or spec, not guessed from its name --
that mattered in practice: cuid's timestamp field turned out not to be zero-padded the way it first
appeared, and ULID/KSUID's alphabets are not the plain `0-9a-z` convention `text_time` defaults to.
If your id is shaped like one of these but isn't quite the same (a fork, a different version), sample
it with [`check_text_time`](reference.md#check_text_time) against your best-guess parameters before
trusting the result -- the same way you would for any other `text_time` column.

**A mixed-case alphabet needs a `COLLATE "C"` column.** A RANGE partition on a `text` column compares
under the column's collation, and the bounds `text_time` computes are ordered by base-N place value,
which is bytewise. Under a locale collation such as `en_US` (the default for most databases) case is a
tertiary weight, so `a` sorts before `P` while base62 puts `a` = 36 above `P` = 25: random-payload
KSUIDs do not sort in timestamp order, and the KSUID recipe above fails at VALIDATE with
`check constraint "pgpm_monolith_bound" ... is violated by some row` (or, on a small table that happens
to pass, routes rows to the wrong month, where retention drops them early). `transmute` and
`check_text_time` compare the alphabet under the control column's collation before touching anything
and refuse, naming the collation and the first misordered digit pair. The fix is a bytewise collation on
the column: `alter table public.events alter column id type text collate "C"` (this rewrites the
table), or declare the column `text collate "C"` when creating it. cuid, ULID-as-text and ObjectId use
single-case alphabets, which `en_US` and most other locales order the way bytes do, so on those they need
nothing. Being single-case is not enough by itself, though, and `transmute` refuses two more kinds of
collation the same way. An ICU collation with numeric ordering (`-u-kn-true`, such as `und-u-kn-true`)
compares a run of digits by its value (`'ck9abcde'` sorts before `'ck10000'`), which misorders every
alphabet that contains digits. A locale with a two-letter contraction treats the pair as one letter:
under Danish (`da-x-icu`) `aa` is `å`, which sorts after `z`, so the ObjectId timestamp `69aa0000`
sorts after `69cc6000`, and under Czech (`cs-x-icu`) `ch` sorts after `h`, which misorders base32 and
ULID's Crockford alphabet (hex has no `h`, so Czech orders hex correctly and is accepted for it). The
check is a proof over every one- and two-character string of the alphabet behind the prefix, so it
refuses exactly the collations that misorder your alphabet that way; `collate "C"` is always safe.

`transmute` commits between its phases, so it has to be called at the **top level**, never inside a
surrounding transaction. That rules out running it from a schema-migration tool that wraps each migration
in one (Prisma, Flyway, Liquibase, Rails, Alembic): it fails there with `invalid transaction termination`.
Convert as an operator-driven step, then let your migrations manage the table afterwards as usual.

Transmutation registers the table **paused** by default: it is converted, but scheduled maintenance does
nothing until you `resume` it (see [Run it](#run-it)). All parameters are in the
[reference](reference.md#conversion).

### The cutover moves no rows

The conversion never rewrites the primary key and never moves a row. Its only `O(rows)` work is a single
read-only scan of the original, which certifies the monolith's bound so the later attach is metadata-only.
Everything after that is a metadata flip: rename, create the parent, attach the monolith, build the
forward grid. No index rebuild, no row rewrite.

**The scan does not block you.** `transmute` runs in three transactions, and the boundary between the
first two is the whole point. `ADD CONSTRAINT ... NOT VALID` takes `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`, but it is catalog
work and instant; that transaction commits and drops the lock; only then does `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` run
the `O(rows)` scan, under `SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE`, which blocks neither readers nor writers. The cutover
that follows is metadata-only. No lock the conversion takes scales with your row count, so there is no
maintenance window to size.

The commit between them is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. Locks are held to transaction end, so two
statements in one transaction means the `ADD`'s `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` is still held while `VALIDATE` scans,
and `VALIDATE`'s lighter lock buys nothing.

**What the conversion does cost is a write ceiling, for its whole duration.** The bound `CHECK` is live
from the moment the first transaction commits until the cutover completes, so across that entire span, and
not merely for one locked statement, a write outside `[lo, hi)` is rejected:

```text
ERROR:  new row for relation "events" violates check constraint "pgpm_monolith_bound"
```

`hi` is the grid boundary just above the frontier, so ordinary writes land well inside it. The case to
plan for is a fast writer that would cross `hi` while the scan runs: pass `p_bound_headroom => <n>` to put
`hi` that many grid steps further out. `lo` is the grid floor of the current minimum, so a *backdated*
write below it is refused for the same window.

**Headroom is not scoped to the conversion: `hi` becomes the monolith's permanent partition bound**, and
regraining the monolith cannot begin until the frontier passes that same `hi` -- so `p_bound_headroom`
also delays how soon *any* of its history becomes eligible for regraining, by the same number of grid
steps. See [`transmute`'s `p_bound_headroom`](reference.md#transmute-time--uuidv7--text_time-grid) for
the tradeoff in full.

**Each phase gives up rather than queueing.** `p_lock_timeout` (`'5s'` by default) bounds how long the
conversion waits for a lock. The locks it takes are brief; what this protects you from is the *wait*,
because a pending `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` request blocks every lock request behind it, so without a bound one
long-running query against your table stalls all of it for as long as that query runs. Raise it in a quiet
window, lower it under heavy traffic. A timeout is safe to retry: re-running `transmute` resumes, from the
same session or a new one.

**If a conversion dies partway, the bound outlives it** and the table goes on refusing those writes.
`pgpm.transmute_abort('public.events')` drops it and puts the table back exactly as it was; its incoming
foreign keys were never touched, because those are dropped only by the cutover itself. It waits at most
`p_lock_timeout` (5 s by default) for the table's lock, and otherwise refuses with nothing changed. You rarely
need to: every `maintain_all` tick sweeps for abandoned conversions and undoes them, deciding "abandoned"
from whether the session that claimed the conversion is still connected rather than from a timeout, so a
long scan is never mistaken for a dead one. The sweep gives up on the table's lock after 5 s, like
`transmute` itself, and retries next tick (a `skip_transmute_reap` row) rather than queue the table's
traffic behind it. Re-running `transmute` resumes from the recorded bound, in the zone that bound was
computed in, rather than recomputing one, so re-run it on the same control column: one on another
column is refused, because the bound constrains the first.

The one hard requirement is that the **control column be `NOT NULL`** (a partition key cannot be null, and
`transmute` never scans to enforce it). A key is *not* required: if the table's **primary key** includes
the control column, `transmute` reuses it in place (the parent adopts the monolith's existing index, no
rebuild); if it has no primary key and a **unique constraint** includes the control column, that is reused
the same way; if it has neither, the table is partitioned **keyless** and no
key is synthesized (faithful to a keyless source, e.g. a plain hypertable). Postgres only requires a
partitioned key to *include* the partition key, not lead it, so a single-column key qualifies, and so does
a composite one that contains it (e.g. `(tenant_id, id)` partitioned by `id`, or `UNIQUE (device_id, ts)`
partitioned by `ts`). A few shapes are still refused with a clear error rather than partitioned on a weak
key:

- **A nullable control column**: run `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN <control> SET NOT NULL` first.
- **A primary key that *excludes* the control column** (the classic `events(id PRIMARY KEY, created_at)`
  wanting time partitioning): make the control column part of the key first, or widen it with `CREATE
  UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` then `ALTER TABLE ... DROP CONSTRAINT <pk>, ADD PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX <idx>`.
  This holds even when a unique constraint that does include the control column sits beside it:
  `transmute` will not adopt that one and leave the primary key behind on the monolith, where it would
  enforce nothing for rows written to newer partitions. The error names the primary key constraint and
  the control column.
- **Only a *bare* unique index** (not a constraint) covers the control column: `ADD UNIQUE` would rebuild
  it, so promote it metadata-only first with `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... UNIQUE USING INDEX`.

Then re-transmute. One consequence of going keyless: `regrain` is unavailable on a keyless monolith (it has
no key to identify rows for a resumable copy), so the history stays as one coarse, queryable monolith. Add
a key before transmuting if you want to regrain the history into fine partitions later.

**Widening a key: which order?** Both orders are legal, and pgpm has no preference. It reads the key to
*identify* rows (a regrain reconciles by equality on the key columns) and never to order them, so nothing
in pgpm is faster one way than the other. That leaves the choice to your own reads, and it is worth making
deliberately: reversing it later costs another `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` and constraint swap, on a
table that has grown since.

A lookup carrying no control-column predicate prunes to nothing either way, so both orders visit every
partition. The difference is what happens inside each one:

- **Lead with the row identifier** (`(id, created_at)`) when the read you care about is a point lookup by
  that identifier. Each partition's local index seeks straight to the row.
- **Lead with the control column** (`(created_at, id)`) when the read you care about is a range scan over
  the control column, and you want the key itself to serve it rather than a separate index.

Either mismatch costs the same thing: a key whose leading column your `WHERE` does not constrain cannot
seek, so each partition's index gets scanned rather than probed. The `(tenant_id, id)` shape above is this
choice already made: the control column sits second because `tenant_id` is what the application filters on.

`transmute` is reversible until you commit to it: while the monolith is intact and holds the whole table,
[`untransmute`](reference.md#untransmute) cleanly restores the original, taking the retention write block
and any in-flight regrain off the monolith on the way (the regrain is abandoned as `regrain_cancel` would
abandon it; the copy work is all that is lost). The table comes back with the owner, grants, row security,
policies, comments, publication memberships and replica identity you gave it after the conversion, not the
ones it had before, in the schema you moved it to, and with the indexes and constraints you added since under
the names you gave them. It becomes a one-way door once a
row lands outside the monolith (the frontier crosses `B`), a regrain swaps its fine children in, or
retention retires the monolith.

## Run it

Schedule maintenance with `pgpm.schedule()`, a thin wrapper around `pg_cron` for the two jobs pgpm needs.
Both stay idle while the table is paused, so inspect with [`status()`](#monitor) first, then `resume`:

```sql
select pgpm.schedule();                   -- two pg_cron jobs (every minute) drive maintain_all() and maintain_obtain_all()
select * from pgpm.status();              -- looks right?
select pgpm.resume('public.events');      -- go live
```

`pgpm.schedule(p_every, p_obtain_every)` takes two independent `pg_cron` schedules (`'* * * * *'` every
minute is the default for both; `'*/5 * * * *'` every 5 minutes; `'30 seconds'` for pg_cron's sub-minute
syntax). pg_cron does not accept `'1 minute'`-style interval strings; minute cadence goes through cron
syntax. It registers a job named `pgpm` that calls `maintain_all()` (write-block, archive, retain,
auto-regrain, FK restore/validate) on `p_every`, and a second job named `pgpm_obtain` that calls
`maintain_obtain_all()` on its own `p_obtain_every` cadence -- so a slow archive/retain/regrain for one
table can never delay obtain for another, since obtain is the one step where falling behind means a
write is rejected outright rather than merely delayed. Re-running `schedule()` updates both cadences in
place. `pgpm.unschedule()` removes both jobs (plus `pgpm_detach`, below). Run these from the database
where `pg_cron` is installed. The raw equivalent is
`cron.schedule('pgpm', '* * * * *', 'call pgpm.maintain_all()')` and
`cron.schedule('pgpm_obtain', '* * * * *', 'call pgpm.maintain_obtain_all()')`.

**Upgrading from a version before this split:** if you already called `pgpm.schedule()` before
upgrading, you must re-run it once to register the new `pgpm_obtain` job -- `maintain()` no longer
obtains at all, so without it obtain silently stops running until the forward grid runs out and writes
start failing. `maintain_all()` also logs a `warn_obtain_unscheduled` row to `pgpm.log` once per sweep
as a backstop if you miss this.

From there, one job's tick obtains ahead, the other's archives and applies retention, restores any
preserved incoming foreign key, and (if auto-regrain is on) advances one regrain microbatch. You can
also transmute with `p_paused => false` to go live immediately and skip `resume`.

To convert and split a table synchronously (tests, one-shot migrations) instead of waiting for the paced
cron, drive it by hand: `obtain` the forward partitions, then `regrain` the monolith once it has frozen
(see [Regrain the history](#regrain-the-history)).

Regrain's pace is set by `config.regrain_batch`, the rows copied per microbatch, with an optional
`regrain_max_blocks` cap so wide rows cannot make one batch huge. It is a fixed rate you set, not one that
reacts to load: regrain copies old, frozen data, so the work is bounded by the size of the coarse child
rather than by your write rate, and you can size a batch from what your disk will absorb.

## Extend the grid past the lookahead ceiling

`obtain` keeps `config.obtain` partitions ahead of the frontier, and that lookahead is the only thing
standing between a write and `no partition of relation ... found for row`. For `time`/`uuidv7`/`text_time`
grids the frontier tracks the clock, so the ceiling advances predictably and rarely matters. An `id` grid's
frontier is DATA-driven, and data can jump: a sequence restart or `setval`, a Snowflake or ULID generator
whose ids are not dense, a bulk import or backfill carrying its own high ids. Once a write like that lands
past the ceiling, there is no recovery -- the write that would advance the frontier is the write that fails.

`pgpm.extend_to(p_parent, p_value, p_max default 10000)` is the relief valve: name a value you know is
coming, and it builds every missing partition on the existing grid up to and including the one that would
hold it, before you ever attempt the write.

```sql
-- a bulk import is about to carry ids up to 50000000, well past the current lookahead
select pgpm.extend_to('public.events', '50000000');
```

`p_value` is in the control column's own representation: a bare id for `id`, a `uuid` literal (as text) for
`uuidv7`, the encoded text id for `text_time`, anything `timestamptz` accepts for `time`. It never moves the
frontier or touches data -- it only makes the future write legal -- and it is idempotent: partitions that
already exist are left alone, and the return value is how many new ones it actually created.

`p_max` bounds how many new partitions ONE call may create, checked up front before any are: a typo'd
value that would need more than `p_max` is refused loudly, creating nothing, rather than silently stopping
partway to the value you actually asked for. Raise `p_max` for a legitimately large jump.

One call is one transaction, and every partition it creates holds its locks until that transaction ends,
so a call is also refused, creating nothing, when its partitions would hold more than half the server's
shared lock table (on stock settings, a few hundred partitions a call). The message says about how many
one call can create: extend in steps of at most that many, each call in its own transaction, or raise
`max_locks_per_transaction`.

Extending forward is unrelated to your retention floor, so extending far ahead and then lowering `retain`
can leave a wide grid above the frontier; that is harmless, just worth knowing.

To change the steady-state lookahead itself rather than pre-extend past it once, use
`pgpm.set_obtain(p_parent, p_obtain)`. It refuses a negative `p_obtain`, which would otherwise silently
and permanently disable lookahead (see [reference](reference.md#set_obtain)). `obtain` holds itself to the
same half of the lock table as `extend_to`, but stops there rather than refusing, so a lookahead larger than
one call can build fills over several ticks.

## Regrain the history

After transmute, the history is one coarse monolith. **Regraining** splits it into proper, fine-grained
partitions. It is optional: a coarse monolith is correct and queryable forever; regraining is what restores
partition pruning and fine-grained retention over the historical span.

How regrain works, and why it is cheap: it **copies** the monolith's rows into new fine children and swaps
them in atomically, then drops the now-empty source. Because it copies rather than deletes, the kept
partitions have no dead tuples and need no vacuum; the cost is transient extra disk (roughly 2x the
range being regrained, while the copies coexist with the source) and the one-time copy I/O. A sub-range
entirely below the retention horizon is reclaimed rather than materialized, so regraining never builds a
partition that retention would immediately drop.

A child can only be regrained once it is **frozen** -- its whole range below the current frontier, so no
live write still lands in it. The monolith freezes once the frontier crosses `B`.

**Regrain by hand** (synchronous, atomic, one transaction):

```sql
select pgpm.regrain_history('public.events');   -- split the oldest coarse child to the configured step
```

`regrain_history` regrains the oldest coarse child (the monolith) to the configured partition step. For a
hierarchical split (monolith to per-year to per-month, to bound the transient disk on a tight volume),
call `pgpm.regrain(parent, child, target_step)` with chosen steps.

A regrain by hand holds a `SHARE` lock on the parent for the whole call: reads carry on, but every write
through the parent waits until it commits. Run it in a quiet window, or use auto-regrain on a table
taking live writes.

**Auto-regrain** (paced across maintenance ticks):

```sql
select pgpm.set_regrain('public.events', '1 month');   -- feather the monolith toward monthly, one microbatch per tick
```

With auto-regrain on, each `maintain` tick advances one budget-sized microbatch of the oldest frozen coarse
child toward the target step, sized by `config.regrain_batch`. It is off by default
(`set_regrain(parent, null)` turns it back off, abandoning any run it has in flight as `regrain_cancel`
would) and always safe to enable: it only paces regraining; it never starts on a child that is not frozen.
A different target while a run is in flight is refused, since the run's copies belong to the step it
started at: let it finish, or `regrain_cancel` it first. The same holds for a hand `regrain_step` or
`regrain` on the child being split: one at another target is refused rather than resuming the run on a
second grid.

`set_regrain` refuses a target step **coarser** than `partition_step`: splitting toward it could only leave
the history at a grain the grid does not have. Equal-or-finer targets are accepted, and `maintain` only ever
selects a frozen coarse child that the target actually **subdivides**, so no target can wedge auto-regrain:
a child the target cannot split is left as it is and the next coarse child is worked instead. The comparison
behind the refusal is made at `partition_anchor`, which is exact between two calendar steps or two fixed
ones but not across kinds: `'30 days'` on a `'1 month'` grid is accepted (narrower than the anchor's
January) although a 30-day cell that starts in February is wider than the calendar month from there. Such
cells stay counted in `status().coarse_partitions` for good, so on a calendar grid prefer a calendar target
(`'1 month'` on a monthly grid) or a fixed one no wider than the grid's shortest cell (28 days for a monthly
grid). For a genuinely hierarchical split (monolith to yearly to monthly, to bound transient disk), drive it
by hand with `pgpm.regrain()`/`regrain_history()` instead -- those stay fully general.

Regrain **copies**; it never deletes from the source. The coarse child stays whole and attached until one
atomic swap detaches it, attaches the fine children, and drops it. So a regrain -- the
paced, cross-tick auto-regrain included -- never undercounts: every row stays visible in the monolith the
whole time, and the swap is atomic, so a concurrent reader never sees a partial state. The kept fine
children only ever receive inserts, so there are no dead tuples and no vacuum. (The one moment regrain
touches a foreign key is that swap; see [incoming foreign keys](#incoming-foreign-keys).)

**Disk.** Regraining needs transient headroom (about 2x the span being regrained) for the copies before the
source is dropped. On an elastic or auto-scaling volume this is absorbed; on a fixed volume, regrain
hierarchically (coarse first, then each coarse child) so each step's footprint stays bounded, or skip
regraining and keep the coarse monolith.

## Monitor

```sql
select * from pgpm.status();        -- one row per managed table: partitions, backlog, progress
```

`status()` surfaces, beyond the static config:

- **`coarse_partitions` and `history_unregrained`** -- how many attached partitions are still coarse
  (wider than one step), and whether any remain. `history_unregrained = true` is the regraining backlog:
  pruning and fine retention are suspended over that coarse span until it is regrained.
- **`newest_bound`** -- the top of the forward grid, and therefore the write-ahead ceiling. An insert
  past it is refused. If this stops advancing, maintenance has stalled and you are burning through your
  slack.
- **`inflight_partitions`** -- regrain copy-children created but not yet attached. These hold duplicates
  of rows still in the monolith, so the parent's count is already complete: it is a transient-disk
  signal, not a read gap.
- **`fks_suspended` / `fks_unvalidated`** -- preserve-managed incoming FKs currently dropped (RI off)
  versus re-added `NOT VALID` but blocked from validation by pre-existing orphans.
- **`regrain_to`** -- the auto-regrain target, or null when the history is deliberately left coarse.

For one table's position in the transmute, freeze, regrain sequence, drill down:

```sql
select * from pgpm.progress('public.events');
```

`progress()` answers the two questions `status()` leaves to arithmetic. **When will the monolith
freeze?** `write_child` is the partition currently taking writes and `write_ceiling` its upper bound as
actually built, headroom included; `freeze_in` is the time left, for the time-grid kinds only, since an
`id` frontier has no clock and pgpm does not guess (`freeze_margin` gives the count of ids instead).
`coarse_frozen > 0` with `regrain_to` null is a history that will not split by itself. **How far along
is the regrain?** `regrain_pct_range` is the exact fraction of the coarse child's range behind the
cursor, `regrain_rows_copied` the rows moved so far, `regrain_rows_total_est` the estimated total, and
`regrain_eta` an extrapolation from the range fraction, null until there is progress to extrapolate
from. The range fraction and the row count are kept separate on purpose: rows are not spread evenly
across a range, and a below-horizon sub-range is skipped without being copied, so neither stands in for
the other. See [`progress`](reference.md#progress) for every column.

For `uuidv7` tables, confirm the column really is time-ordered (not random UUIDv4):

```sql
select * from pgpm.check_uuidv7('public.events', 'event_uuid');
```

For `text_time` tables, the equivalent check needs the declared shape:

```sql
select * from pgpm.check_text_time('public.events', 'id', 'c', 8, 36, 'ms');
```

A low `fraction` means the values do not match the shape or do not decode to plausible timestamps, and
the table should not be partitioned on that column. Both also report `newest_decoded`, the column's actual
maximum decoded (NULLs skipped), and `newest_in_future`, true when it sits more than an hour ahead of the
clock: a single future-dated row leaves `fraction` near `1.0` yet would pin the monolith's permanent upper
bound at its date, which `transmute` refuses (see [Caveats](#caveats-and-v1-scope)). For an
`id`-partitioned table where you want calendar retention, check that a timestamp column rises with the id:

```sql
select * from pgpm.check_time_monotonic('public.events', 'id', 'created_at');
```

If [`pg_flight_recorder`](https://github.com/dventimisupabase/pg_flight_recorder) is installed,
`pgpm.impact_report('public.events')` correlates pgpm's operation log against the database telemetry PGFR
sampled, reporting what a conversion did to the workload (forced checkpoints, WAL, top waits, query latency)
over the window pgpm was active. It ships with `pgpm_core`; PGFR is never a dependency, it just raises a
clear error until PGFR is installed. See the
[reference](reference.md#observability-with-pg_flight_recorder-observe).

## Retain

Set a policy at transmute time (`p_retain`) or later with `pgpm.set_retain(p_parent, p_retain)`, and
maintenance drops partitions past it. Retain is an interval for `time`/`uuidv7`/`text_time` and a count
of ids for `id` (it is subtracted from the frontier, the highest id written). It must not be negative: a
negative value is refused by both, because it puts the horizon past the partition taking writes and the
next maintenance tick would drop every partition. For an interval that means no field may be negative:
`'-1 year 360 days'` compares equal to zero but is refused, because a calendar year is longer than 360
days and its horizon would land in the future. Zero keeps only the partition taking writes; `null`
keeps everything.

```sql
select pgpm.set_retain('public.events', '90 days');
```

`retain` is the destructive knob -- it decides what gets dropped -- so `set_retain` validates
`p_retain`'s shape against `control_kind` and **refuses** (does not merely warn) a tighter value that
would make the very next `retain()` tick drop a partition the old value still kept. Loosening, or
setting `null` to keep everything, never drops anything and is always accepted; it does not reopen a
partition that archiving has already begun to cover, which stays read-only (see
[Archiving before a drop](#archiving-before-a-drop)). See [reference](reference.md#set_retain).

Retain drops a partition only when its **whole range** is older than the horizon, using plain `DROP` (a
brief lock) when nothing references the table. Two consequences in the monolith model:

- **Retention over un-regrained coarse history is all-or-nothing.** A coarse monolith *spanning* the
  horizon is not dropped, because it still holds within-horizon data, so its aged span is not reclaimed
  for as long as it straddles. The monolith is **not exempt** from retention, though: it is an ordinary
  child partition, and once its whole range is past the horizon it drops like any other, in one step,
  cancelling any regrain still splitting it (its copies are reclaimed; retention has already taken
  everything that regrain would have produced).
  Since its upper bound `B` sits just above the frontier at conversion, that happens roughly one retention
  period after you convert, and reclaims the whole history at once.
  What regraining changes is the *granularity*: split into fine children, each drops on its own schedule,
  so storage falls gradually instead of in one cliff, and the aged history goes sooner than that one
  period. Regrain is also retention-aware -- it skips the below-horizon sub-ranges (never copies them;
  they are discarded with the source at the swap) instead of materializing partitions only to drop them,
  so its transient disk is bounded by the span you are *keeping*, not by the whole child. On a table you
  want aggressively retained, enable auto-regrain (or regrain by hand) to let retention reach the history
  sooner.
- **A referenced partition is retired over several ticks, not one.** If any foreign key points at the
  managed table, retention first deletes any aged rows that something still references, which fires that
  key's `ON DELETE` and can reach into the referencing table; then it detaches the partition on a later
  tick; then it drops it. That path needs `pgpm.schedule()`; see
  [Retention with an incoming foreign key](#retention-with-an-incoming-foreign-key).

**Retention is a standing floor, not just an aging process.** The policy is "no data with a control value
below the horizon persists" -- aging is just the usual way rows cross that line. A row inserted with a
control value *already* past the horizon (a backdated or late-arriving record) is subject to retention
immediately: the next maintenance cycle reclaims it, exactly as any retention system would. The `INSERT`
succeeds; a later, separate maintenance transaction removes the row per policy. If you need late-arriving
data kept for a window *from arrival*, retain on an ingestion timestamp rather than event time, or widen
the policy.

**Drops can also be driven from outside the schedule.** `pgpm.retire(parent, child)` is the sanctioned
single-partition drop -- the same protocol `retain` runs (write-block ensure, archive-coverage check,
`DROP`, bookkeeping), callable one partition at a time. It never drops anything retention would not
(the partition's whole range must be past the horizon), and each partition is claim-guarded so several
cooperating callers can work alongside the scheduled `retain` without stepping on each other. See
`retire` in the [reference](reference.md#retire).

### Archiving before a drop

A partition gets a `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE` trigger the moment it crosses the retention
horizon, independent of whether or how it is archived -- a backdated write into an eligible,
not-yet-dropped range is rejected outright rather than silently diverging an archive from what is
still live. If you also want the *drop* itself to wait until archiving has actually happened, set
`config.archive_fn` to a resumable archive strategy with `pgpm.set_archive_fn`:

```sql
select pgpm.set_archive_fn('public.events', 'myschema.my_archiver(regclass,name,text,text)'::regprocedure);
```

`null` (the default) means no archiving: a write-blocked partition is immediately drop-ready. With
`archive_fn` set, `pgpm.maintain()` archives eligible children in bounded chunks on its own schedule
(sized by `config.archive_byte_budget`) -- one partition at a time, oldest first, by default
(`config.archive_batch`, default `1`; raise it or set it `null` if a large backlog catching up
faster matters more than that bound -- see [the reference](reference.md#byte-budget-chunked-archiving)).
There is no single optimal `archive_byte_budget` -- the compression window, `statement_timeout`,
query-pattern pruning, and per-file overhead all pull in different directions; see [sizing
`archive_byte_budget`](reference.md#sizing-archive_byte_budget-there-is-no-single-optimal-size) for
the tradeoffs and a method for picking one. Either way,
`pgpm.retire()` will not drop a child until `pgpm._archive_fully_covered` confirms every chunk has
landed -- a child mid-archive is a normal, retryable state, not a failure, and nothing here fails
loudly the way a hook used to; `retire()` just returns `false` and tries again next tick. See [the
reference](reference.md#archive-strategy-contract) for the full calling contract
(`archive_fn(p_parent, p_child, p_lo, p_hi) returns pgpm.archive_result`), and [the pgpm_archive
add-on](../pgpm_archive/README.md) for two ready-made S3 strategies
(`pgpm.archive_to_s3_ndjson`/`pgpm.archive_to_s3_parquet`) built on this contract.

**A covered partition stays read-only until it drops.** Once archiving has recorded coverage for a
partition, its write block stays even if retention later stops reaching it (a loosened `retain`, or on
an `id` table a frontier that moved back because the newest rows were deleted), because the archive is
only true of a partition nothing has written to since. The partition is archived to completion and
dropped only if retention reaches it again; the log says so once, as `skip_write_block_lift`. To make
such a partition writable again, delete its `pgpm.archive_ledger` rows and the next tick lifts the
block (archiving starts over from the partition's `lo` if it is ever blocked again).

**Do not rename a partition out from under pgpm.** Every step of the retention lifecycle is handed
the partition's *name*, and a name that has stopped meaning what it meant would have the write block
installed on the wrong relation, the chunk sized from its rows, and the coverage that records is what
lets the real partition be dropped. So pgpm records each partition's oid when it creates it, and
every step that would act on the name checks it first: you get `fail_write_block_identity`,
`fail_archive_identity` or `fail_retain_identity` in the log, depending on how far the partition got,
and a partition that stays put rather than a wrong object in your bucket and a drop authorised by it.
All three stay wedged until you sort the name out. A partition restored from a dump under its own name is
a new relation as far as pgpm can tell, so it wedges the same way: record it with
`select pgpm.adopt_partition('public.events', 'public.<partition>')` rather than deleting its `pgpm.part`
row, which would leave it attached and never archived or retired. If you do need to rename one, update
`pgpm.part.child_name` and `pgpm.archive_ledger.child_name` in the same transaction: a rename does
not change an oid, so the recorded identity is still right afterwards, and the ledger matches a
partition's archived chunks by name, so carrying the name keeps its coverage attached and archiving
resumes from where it left off. That is exactly what `regrain`'s own transitional rename does.

```sql
begin;
alter table public.events_p2026_03 rename to events_2026_03_history;
update pgpm.part          set child_name = 'events_2026_03_history'
 where parent_table = 'public.events'::regclass and child_name = 'events_p2026_03';
update pgpm.archive_ledger set child_name = 'events_2026_03_history'
 where parent_table = 'public.events'::regclass and child_name = 'events_p2026_03';
commit;
```

If the ledger is left behind (the procedure as this guide used to document it), pgpm does not wedge on
it:
the next archive tick finds coverage under a name that is no longer a tracked partition, over a
range the renamed partition holds, discards it (logged once as `archive_coverage_reset`, with the
old name in `method`) and archives the partition again from its `lo`. Nothing is lost either way;
the difference is whether the chunks already exported are exported a second time.

**Moving the table to another schema is safe.** `ALTER TABLE public.events SET SCHEMA history` moves
the managed table only: its partitions stay in `public`, and the partitions pgpm creates afterwards go in
`history`. pgpm tracks the table by identity, and every step of the retention lifecycle finds a partition
in its own schema through the identity it recorded for it, so write blocks, archiving and retirement carry
on across the move, and an `untransmute` hands the table back in `history`. A regrain under way carries on
too, its copies staying beside the partition they replace, and a preserved incoming foreign key is put back
against the table where it is now, not wherever its old name points. A rename is still a rename,
though: the steps look a partition up by name in that schema, so the advice above applies wherever the
partition lives.

**Renaming the partition-key column is safe.** `ALTER TABLE public.events RENAME COLUMN created_at TO
occurred_at` keeps the table routing, and pgpm follows it: every step finds the control column through the
parent's partition key, which PostgreSQL holds by attribute number, so obtain keeps extending the grid,
and retention, regrain, `set_partition_tz` and `untransmute` all act on the column under its new name.
`pgpm.config.control_column` keeps the name it had at transmute. Rename between regrains rather than
during one: a regrain in flight captures changes through a trigger minted from the name it had when
that regrain began, and the next one mints its trigger from the new name.

`status().retain_backlog` tracks partitions still waiting on their turn to drop; it falling tick over
tick is normal draining (either a paced backlog or archiving still catching up), while flat with
`retain_drop_failures` climbing means something else is wrong -- an unexpected `DROP` failure, not
archiving simply not having caught up yet (that shows as `retain_drop_failures` staying at zero). See
the runbook's
[retention entry](runbook.md#storage-is-not-dropping-despite-a-retention-policy) for the full
diagnostic.

## Incoming foreign keys

Foreign keys in **both** directions survive the conversion.

An **outgoing** key (the table you are transmuting referencing another table) is carried onto the new
parent for you, with no option to configure and nothing to run afterwards. It has to be carried, because a
foreign key follows the table it is defined on and the conversion renames your table aside to become the
monolith child: left alone, the constraint would keep enforcing over the monolith's range only, and a row
written into a forward partition would escape it. Carrying it is metadata-only, since PostgreSQL adopts the
monolith's already-validated copy rather than rescanning. A `NOT VALID` outgoing key is refused up front:
adding it at the parent would rescan the whole table under a lock that blocks writes on it and on the
referenced table, so validate or drop it first.

The rest of this section is about the **incoming** direction, where other tables reference the one you are
transmuting (e.g. `reactions(message_id) -> messages(id)`). Because `transmute` never rewrites the primary
key, the referenced unique key always survives partitioning, so an incoming FK to the primary key is always
preservable: no composite key, no denormalization, ever.

There is one mechanical wrinkle, and it is the cutover itself. A foreign key tracks the table it
references by identity, not by name, and the cutover *renames your table aside* to become the monolith
child and puts a new parent in its place under the original name. An FK left in place would therefore
still reference the **monolith partition**, not the new logical table. It stays valid and keeps
enforcing, which is what makes this dangerous rather than merely wrong: the constraint has silently
narrowed to one partition, so any new referencing row pointing at data that has since landed in a
forward partition is rejected.

```text
ERROR:  insert or update on table "reactions" violates foreign key constraint "reactions_message_id_fkey"
DETAIL:  Key (message_id)=(1500) is not present in table "messages".
```

So the FK cannot ride through the cutover in place: it is dropped for the conversion and re-added
against the new parent. (Regrain is different -- it copies, never moving a referenced row out of the
parent -- so its multi-tick copy needs no such handling; only its atomic swap touches the FK, see below.)

`transmute` offers two modes for incoming FKs:

- **`p_incoming_fks => 'error'` (default):** detect incoming FKs and refuse, mutating nothing.
- **`p_incoming_fks => 'preserve'`:** the cutover drops each incoming FK and records it in the same
  transaction (the referencing table is otherwise untouched); it is re-added against the new parent on a
  later maintenance tick. A conversion that fails before the cutover, or in it, leaves the key where it
  was. (`'drop'` is accepted too, but takes the same path: the keys are recorded and restored just the
  same.) A `NOT VALID` incoming key is refused up front, as a `NOT VALID` outgoing one is: maintenance
  validates every key it re-adds, so it would promote a key you left unvalidated or, over the orphans you
  tolerate, fail and retry for good. Validate or drop it first.

With `'preserve'`, `pgpm.restore_incoming_fks(parent)` re-adds each FK against the new parent; `maintain`
calls it automatically, so on the scheduled path you do nothing. It is a no-op while an in-flight,
not-yet-attached child exists mid-regrain, so it is safe to call early or repeatedly. Because the monolith
holds every referenced row attached from the moment of cutover, the FK is normally restorable immediately
after transmute.

```sql
call pgpm.transmute('public.events', 'id', 10000000, p_incoming_fks => 'preserve');
select pgpm.restore_incoming_fks('public.events');   -- maintenance does this for you on the cron path
```

Two honest points about the window the FK is dropped:

- **RI is off on the referencing table while the FK is down.** Writes to the referencing table go
  unchecked during that window, and `status().fks_suspended` surfaces it. The window opens at the
  cutover, not when `transmute` is called: the validation scan runs with the key still in place.
  `'preserve'` is opt-in; if the referencing table takes heavy writes, keep the window short (restore
  promptly) or `pause`.
- **An orphan written during that window will not brick the restore.** The re-add is split: `ADD
  CONSTRAINT ... NOT VALID` (which already enforces every *new* write) is committed separately from
  `VALIDATE`. If a pre-existing orphan blocks `VALIDATE`, the FK is left `NOT VALID` (still enforcing new
  writes, surfaced by `status().fks_unvalidated`) rather than rolled back. List blockers with
  `pgpm.incoming_fk_orphans(parent)`, remove them, then `pgpm.validate_incoming_fks(parent)`:

```sql
select * from pgpm.incoming_fk_orphans('public.events');   -- which FK, how many orphan rows
-- ... delete or fix the offending referencing rows ...
select pgpm.validate_incoming_fks('public.events');        -- validates the now-clean FKs
```

For the full step-by-step recovery, see the runbook entry
[Referential-integrity violations after a `preserve` conversion](runbook.md#referential-integrity-violations-after-a-preserve-conversion).

One exception on PostgreSQL 15 to 17: a key whose referencing table is **partitioned**, which includes a
self-referential key of the table you converted, cannot be re-added `NOT VALID` there, so it comes back
validated in one step. That re-add scans the whole referencing table while it blocks writes to the managed
table, and an orphan fails it and leaves the key dropped until you remove the orphan. PostgreSQL 18 takes
`NOT VALID` on a partitioned table, and there such a key gets the same split as any other. See
[`restore_incoming_fks`](reference.md#restore_incoming_fks) for why pgpm does not work around it.

**Once restored, it stays restored.** Nothing in a maintenance tick suspends a managed FK again;
`pgpm.suspend_incoming_fks` has exactly one caller left, described next. Referential actions,
`DEFERRABLE`-ness, and self-referential FKs are all preserved across the drop-and-restore.

Auto-regrain needs **no suspension during the copy**: a regrain copies, so every referenced row stays in
the monolith and is never outside the parent. The single exception is the swap's `DETACH` -- Postgres
refuses to detach a partition whose rows are still referenced -- so the swap transiently drops the incoming
FK(s) and re-adds them *within that one atomic transaction*. No other session ever observes RI off, and the
synchronous `regrain()` is atomic end to end.

### Retention with an incoming foreign key

A foreign key pointing at the managed table changes how [retention](#retain) reclaims a partition, whether
or not it was `preserve`-managed. Retiring a referenced partition is a sequence rather than a single
`DROP`, and its first step is the one that can touch a table you did not hand to pgpm.

**First, rows that are still referenced are deleted, under the `ON DELETE` rule you declared.** If a live
row in the referencing table points at a row in the aged partition, pgpm issues a `DELETE` for exactly
those keys and lets PostgreSQL apply whatever the foreign key says. That can reach beyond the managed
table: `CASCADE` deletes the referencing rows, and if those rows are themselves referenced with `CASCADE`,
the deletion carries on into that table too.

| `ON DELETE` | what happens to the referencing row | retention |
|---|---|---|
| `CASCADE` | deleted | proceeds |
| `SET NULL` / `SET DEFAULT` | kept, reference severed | proceeds |
| `NO ACTION` (the default) / `RESTRICT` | untouched | **blocked**, with PostgreSQL's own error |

The work is bounded by the crossing rows, not by the partition or the referencing table. A successful
crossing is logged `retain_crossing` with the key and row counts, because this is the one point where
retiring a partition writes outside the partition itself. A blocked one logs `fail_retain_crossing`
carrying the constraint's own error, counts in `status().retain_drop_failures`, and leaves the partition
whole. That is not a pgpm limitation to work around: a `NO ACTION` foreign key is a statement that these
rows must not disappear while something points at them, and retention honouring it is the constraint doing
its job. Change the referential action, or remove the referencing rows, if you meant otherwise. When
nothing references the aged rows, this step deletes nothing and logs nothing.

**Then the partition is detached, on a later tick, by the `pgpm_detach` cron job.** A referenced partition
cannot be dropped while it is attached, even when no row references it and even when the referencing table
is empty. `retire` cannot run that detach itself, so it hands it to a standing cron job and returns; that
is what makes this path asynchronous, and what `pgpm.schedule()` is for here.

**Then it is dropped**, by the next `retire` call that finds it detached. The referencing table's own
foreign key survives the whole sequence and keeps enforcing.

Three things follow, and none of them are optional:

- **`pgpm.schedule()` is required to retire a referenced partition.** Without the `pgpm_detach` job there
  is nowhere to hand the detach to, and `retire` logs `fail_retain_detach` rather than reclaiming. If you
  scheduled pgpm before upgrading, re-run `pgpm.schedule()` once to create that job.
- **Retirement spans at least one extra tick.** `status().retain_detaching` counts partitions whose
  detach is in flight. Retention was already eventual, so this lengthens a delay rather than adding one.
  If retention stops reaching the partition in that window (you loosen it with `set_retain`, or the
  newest rows of an `id` table are deleted and its frontier moves back), the retirement is taken back:
  the detach is recalled before it runs (`retain_recall`), or, if it had already started, the partition
  is re-attached on the next tick (`retain_reattach`). The partition keeps its rows either way.
- **Writes to the *referencing* table are blocked while the detach runs**, once per retirement, for a
  duration set by that table's size. Reads of it, and your managed table entirely, are unaffected. This is
  irreducible: it is PostgreSQL proving the foreign key still holds. An index on the referencing column is
  ordinary good practice but does not shorten it.

**Do not rename or replace a partition while its retirement is in flight.** The detach reaches the cron
job as text naming the partition, so pgpm records the partition's oid when it dispatches and refuses to
detach or drop anything else that turns up under the name. You get `fail_retain_identity` in the log, with
both oids in `method`, and a retirement that stays wedged until you sort the name out, rather than a
dropped table. `status().retain_detaching` tells you when a retirement is in flight. The same refusal
guards the ordinary one-step `DROP`, against the oid recorded when the partition was created, so a
substituted name is refused on every retirement path. If you genuinely need to rename a partition, update
`pgpm.part.child_name` in the same transaction: a rename does not change an oid, so the recorded identity
stays right, which is exactly what `regrain`'s own transitional rename does.

## Secondary indexes

`transmute` copies the old table's non-unique secondary indexes onto the parent as partitioned indexes
(reusing the monolith's existing index, no rebuild), so they propagate to every partition, including the
fine children that regrain creates. A unique secondary index is carried the same way **when its key
includes the partition key** (so global uniqueness is genuinely preserved). One that backs a `UNIQUE`
constraint is carried as the constraint, under its own name and with its deferrability, so
`ON CONFLICT ON CONSTRAINT <name>` and a `DEFERRABLE` check work on every partition as they did on the table. One whose key excludes the
partition key cannot be a partitioned unique index, so `transmute` **refuses** rather than silently
dropping the guarantee: add the partition key to that index, or drop it, then re-transmute. An exclusion
constraint (`EXCLUDE`) is refused for the same reason: its index cannot be carried onto a partitioned
table, so drop the constraint if the table can do without it.

## How the conversion avoids a rewrite

Two facts about Postgres drive the design:

1. You cannot convert a table to partitioned in place, so transmute renames the live table, creates a
   partitioned parent under the original name, and attaches the old table as a bounded child. No rows
   move; the app sees no change.
2. Attaching a partition whose rows are not certified in range forces a scan under `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`,
   which would block the workload.

pgpm sidesteps the second with a scan-skip attach: certify the bound with a validated `CHECK` *before* the
attach, so the attach itself is metadata-only. Certifying it is `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`, whose own
`SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE` lock blocks nobody, and it gets a transaction to itself so no earlier statement's
lock is still held while it scans. See
[The cutover moves no rows](#the-cutover-moves-no-rows) for what that does and does not cost.

```sql
ADD CONSTRAINT b CHECK (control >= lo AND control < hi) NOT VALID  -- catalog only, instant, ACCESS EXCLUSIVE
COMMIT                                                             -- drops that ACCESS EXCLUSIVE
VALIDATE CONSTRAINT b                                              -- the scan, under SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
COMMIT
ATTACH PARTITION ...                                               -- scan skipped, metadata-only
```

The monolith attaches this way at transmute (one scan of the original). `obtain`'s forward
partitions need no scan at all: they are created empty, so there is nothing to certify. Regrain's fine
children are born with their bound `CHECK`, so they
too attach metadata-only. The one rule that keeps it safe: never certify a range that is still receiving
writes -- the monolith covers up to `B` (a boundary above the frontier) precisely so the current interval
lives inside it, and regrain only touches frozen children.

## Read consistency

There is no read gap. A `SELECT` against the parent always sees every row, at every moment, on the paced
path as much as the synchronous one.

A query against a partitioned parent scans only its **attached** partitions, so the way to open a gap
would be to take a row out of an attached partition and hold it somewhere not yet attached. Nothing in
pgpm does that. `regrain` **copies** and never deletes from its source: the coarse child stays whole and
attached until a single transaction detaches it, attaches the fine children and drops it, so every row is
visible through the parent the entire time and no reader ever sees a partial state.

Its in-flight copies (`status().inflight_partitions`) are therefore duplicates of rows still in the
monolith, not rows in transit. They cost transient disk; they never cost you a row.

## WAL and checkpoint sizing

Copying rows rewrites them, so a **regrain** is a burst of WAL concentrated over the regrain window. If
`max_wal_size` is small relative to that WAL rate plus your ambient write load, Postgres fires *requested*
(forced) checkpoints whenever WAL hits the limit, rather than gentle *timed* checkpoints. A forced
checkpoint flushes a burst of dirty buffers; on a throughput-limited disk that flush can stall the
workload for seconds. At scale this, not the row movement itself, is usually the worst latency you see.

How to tell:

```sql
-- PG 17+; on 15/16 use pg_stat_bgwriter.checkpoints_req / checkpoints_timed
select num_requested, num_timed from pg_stat_checkpointer;
```

A meaningful and growing `num_requested` means `max_wal_size` is too small for your write rate. What to do:

- **Raise `max_wal_size`** so checkpoints are time-driven. Rough target:
  `max_wal_size >= peak_WAL_rate x checkpoint_timeout`, with headroom. The cost is longer crash recovery
  and more `pg_wal` disk. On Supabase, `max_wal_size`/`checkpoint_timeout` are not scaled by tier; set
  them via the CLI (reloads without restart):

  ```bash
  supabase --experimental --project-ref <ref> postgres-config update --config max_wal_size=16GB
  ```

- **Or spread the producer out.** Auto-regrain advances one budget-sized microbatch per maintenance tick,
  so the burst becomes a trickle; `config.regrain_batch` (with `regrain_max_blocks` for wide rows) sets how
  big each one is. The two remedies compose: raise `max_wal_size` where you can, and regrain in smaller
  batches where you cannot.

## Operations and troubleshooting

For step-by-step procedures when an alert fires, see the [runbook](runbook.md). Quick reference:

- **Pause / resume.** `select pgpm.pause('public.events');` / `select pgpm.resume('public.events');`. A
  paused table is registered but untouched by `maintain` (you can still drive `obtain`/`regrain` by hand).
- **A write is refused with `no partition of relation ... found for row`.** The value is outside the
  forward grid. Check `status().newest_bound`: if it has stopped advancing, maintenance has stalled;
  otherwise the write is further ahead than `config.obtain x partition_step` reaches. See the
  [runbook](runbook.md) for both cases.
- **History is not being split.** `status().history_unregrained` is true and you want fine partitions:
  enable auto-regrain (`set_regrain`) or run `regrain_history` by hand once the monolith has frozen.
- **Re-transmuting a table fails with an "orphan" error.** An interrupted regrain creates child
  partitions as standalone tables before attaching them; an un-attached child survives a `DROP TABLE
  <parent> CASCADE`. `transmute` detects a leftover and refuses up front; drop the named orphan and retry.
  The same up-front refusal names any other relation (a sequence, a view) holding a child-partition name,
  and a relation holding the name the monolith itself will take (`<table>_p<lo>_to_<hi>`), typically a
  monolith detached from an earlier conversion of a table by that name.
- **Re-running `transmute` on a table it already converted is refused.** `transmute` converts a table
  once; the message says the earlier cutover did commit, and `status()` shows the table managed. There is
  nothing to resume, and the refusal costs nothing. A conversion that failed *before* its cutover, on the
  other hand, is resumed by a re-run, from the same session or a new one.

## Caveats and v1 scope

- **Dimensions:** `time` (interval step; whole-month or fixed-duration; mixing rejected), `id`
  (bigint/numeric step), `uuidv7`/ULID-as-uuid (time grid, uuid bounds), `text_time` (time grid, a
  declared `<prefix><fixed-width base-N epoch>` TEXT shape -- cuid, KSUID, ULID-as-text, ObjectId).
  `float`/`double` rejected; an encoding whose alphabet order does not track its digit-value order, or
  whose timestamp field is not fixed-width, partitions on a companion column instead.
- **Monotonicity is the precondition.** UUIDv7/ULID are ms-resolution monotonic with a small
  clock-skew/late-arrival window, and a straggler still lands in whichever partition already covers its
  key. Arbitrary backdated keys break it: with no `DEFAULT`, a key outside the grid is refused outright.
- **A future-dated id pins the monolith.** For `time`, `uuidv7` and `text_time` the frontier is the newer
  of the column's maximum and the clock (for `time`, so the monolith covers a scheduled or future-dated
  row rather than failing on it mid-conversion), so one row minted by a client whose clock is years wrong
  would set the monolith's permanent `hi` years out: every row written until then lands in the monolith, `status()` looks
  normal, and nothing can be regrained or dropped until the clock really gets there. The plausibility
  sampling (for the id kinds) does not see one bad row in hundreds. `transmute` therefore refuses a maximum more than one
  partition step plus one hour ahead of `now()`, naming the value and its decoded timestamp; ordinary skew
  of minutes is always accepted. Delete or correct the rows and re-run, or accept the far `hi` knowingly
  with `p_force_frontier => true`. [`check_uuidv7`](reference.md#check_uuidv7) and
  [`check_text_time`](reference.md#check_text_time) report the maximum as `newest_decoded` and flag it as
  `newest_in_future` so you can see it before converting.
- **The cutover moves no rows and blocks nobody:** no row movement, no PK rewrite, no index rebuild, and
  the one `O(rows)` scan runs in its own transaction under `SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE`. What it costs instead
  is a write ceiling: the bound `CHECK` refuses writes outside `[lo, hi)` for the whole conversion (see
  [The cutover moves no rows](#the-cutover-moves-no-rows)).
- **The history starts coarse.** It is one monolith partition until regrained; until then, pruning and
  fine-grained retention are suspended over its span. A coarse monolith is a valid permanent state.
- **Regrain needs transient disk** (about 2x the span being regrained) and copies the rows; both the
  synchronous and the paced auto-regrain path are gap-free (the source stays whole and attached until the
  atomic swap, which transiently drops and re-adds any incoming FK within one transaction).
- **There is no `DEFAULT`**: a write outside the forward grid is refused rather than parked.
- **Table names have a byte budget.** Every partition is named `<rel>_p<label>` (the monolith
  `<rel>_p<lo>_to_<hi>`), and pgpm never lets PostgreSQL cut such a name to 63 bytes, because a cut
  label makes two cells share a name and the grid would silently stop growing. `transmute` refuses a
  table whose derived names would not fit, and `set_regrain` a target step whose wider labels would not;
  both say how many bytes to shorten the table name by. On a monthly grid the table name can be up to 43
  bytes when the data spans more than one month; the full budget is under
  [Partition naming](reference.md#partition-naming).
- **Retain uses plain `DROP`** (a brief lock); retention over coarse history waits on regrain.
- **Logical-replication subscribers are covered.** Both pgpm triggers, the write block and the regrain
  change capture, are enabled `ALWAYS`, so a write applied with `session_replication_role = replica` is
  refused, or captured, exactly as an ordinary write is.
- **Unique secondary indexes** are carried when their key includes the partition key; otherwise refused. A
  unique constraint stays a constraint, under its own name and with its deferrability.
- **The tablespace** is carried: the parent is created in the table's, so every partition pgpm mints lands
  there, and the roles that run `transmute` and maintenance need `CREATE` on it.
- **The key is never rewritten;** a primary key or unique constraint that includes the control column is
  reused in place, under its own constraint name on the parent, and a keyless table is partitioned
  keyless. The control column must be `NOT NULL`.
- **Replica identity** is carried to the parent and to every partition pgpm mints, so a published table
  keeps accepting `UPDATE` and `DELETE` past the monolith.
- **Incoming foreign keys** are refused by default, or preserved (dropped for the conversion, re-added
  against the new parent) with `p_incoming_fks => 'preserve'`.
- **There is no read gap.** A `SELECT` against the parent always sees every row, on the paced path as much
  as the synchronous one, because regrain copies and never moves a row out of an attached partition; see
  [Read consistency](#read-consistency).
- Tested on PostgreSQL **15, 16, 17, and 18**.
- **Boundaries align to the zone of the session that ran `transmute`**, recorded in
  `pgpm.config.partition_tz` and used for every later boundary and partition name whatever zone
  maintenance runs in. Month and year boundaries are midnight on the 1st in that zone; day and shorter
  steps are a fixed number of seconds, so in a zone with daylight saving a daily boundary sits an hour
  off local midnight for part of the year, and their partitions are named by the UTC date (or hour)
  they start at. A `timestamp` or `date` column has no zone: its grid is the column's own wall clock
  (recorded as `UTC`), so its days and hours are whole wall days and hours in the column's values, and
  its zone cannot be changed. For UTC boundaries on a `timestamptz` column, `set timezone = 'UTC'`
  before the call; change the zone afterwards only with `pgpm.set_partition_tz`, which refuses a change
  the grid built so far is not on, and any change while a regrain is in flight.
