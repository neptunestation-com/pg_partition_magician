# pg_partition_magician operational runbook

Symptom-driven, step-by-step procedures for operators. When something alerts you, find the matching entry
and follow the steps top to bottom. This is the "do this, then this" book, deliberately distinct from the
other docs:

- the [README](../README.md) is the front door;
- the [user guide](guide.md) explains the *concepts* and how to use pgpm;
- the [reference](reference.md) documents *every* function and catalog object;
- the [explainer](https://neptunestation-com.github.io/pg_partition_magician/) is the visual overview;
- **this runbook** is what you reach for at 2am, when you do not want to reconstruct a procedure from bits
  scattered across the others.

Every entry has the same shape: **Symptom** (how you noticed) -> **What it means** (one paragraph) ->
**Steps** (numbered, copy-paste) -> **Verify** -> **Prevent**.

## Referential-integrity violations after a `preserve` conversion

**Symptom.** Any of: an incoming foreign key on a table that points at a pgpm-managed parent shows as
`NOT VALID`; `pgpm.status()` reports `fks_unvalidated > 0`; `pgpm.log` has `fail_validate_incoming_fk`
rows; or a periodic RI audit (or an application error) flags dangling references into the parent.

**What it means.** You converted with `p_incoming_fks => 'preserve'`. The **cutover** drops each incoming
FK, because it renames your table aside to become the monolith child and an FK left in place would go on
referencing that partition rather than the new parent. Referential integrity is therefore off on the
referencing table from the cutover until `pgpm.restore_incoming_fks` re-adds the constraint against the new
parent -- the next maintenance tick, or immediately if you call it by hand. (This is by design and visible
as `status().fks_suspended`; see the guide's
[incoming foreign keys](guide.md#incoming-foreign-keys).) The re-add enforces every *new* write straight
away (as `NOT VALID`), but it could not fully *validate* the constraint, because rows that violate it were
written during that window. Those orphans are real RI violations to reconcile; new writes are already
guarded again. The attribution is exact: the FK was valid when pgpm dropped it, so any orphan present now
arose during the window.

Two things that do *not* produce orphans this way. **Regrain** copies rather than moves, and its swap drops
and re-adds the FK inside one atomic transaction, so no session observes RI off. **Retention** honours
whatever the foreign key declares in its `ON DELETE` clause (see
[retention with an incoming foreign key](guide.md#retention-with-an-incoming-foreign-key)), so it severs or
refuses rather than leaving a dangling reference. The one remaining way maintenance can strand a reference
is a regrain discarding aged, still-referenced sub-ranges below the retention horizon, which it only does
when `archive_fn` is unset; the reconciliation below applies unchanged.

**Steps.**

1. Confirm the state and see which parents are affected:

   ```sql
   select parent, fks_suspended, fks_unvalidated from pgpm.status();
   ```

   `fks_unvalidated > 0` for a parent means an incoming FK was re-added but is blocked from validation. (If
   instead `fks_suspended > 0`, a move is still in flight and the FK is currently fully dropped: let it
   finish, or bound it, before reconciling -- see **Prevent**.)

2. List the blocked foreign keys and how many orphan rows each has:

   ```sql
   select * from pgpm.incoming_fk_orphans('public.events');   -- the managed parent
   -- referencing_table | constraint_name | orphan_rows
   ```

3. Inspect the offending rows so you can decide what to do. For a single-column FK (`reactions.event_id`
   referencing `events.id`, say):

   ```sql
   select r.*
     from public.reactions r                                  -- referencing_table from step 2
    where r.event_id is not null                              -- the FK column(s)
      and not exists (select 1 from public.events p where p.id = r.event_id);
   ```

   For a composite FK, repeat the equality for each referencing/referenced column pair.

4. Reconcile, according to your data model. Choose one per table:

   - **Delete** the orphans if they are junk:

     ```sql
     delete from public.reactions r
      where r.event_id is not null
        and not exists (select 1 from public.events p where p.id = r.event_id);
     ```

   - **Repoint** them to a valid parent key, if they belong elsewhere (an `update`).
   - **Restore** the missing parent rows, if a parent-side delete during the window was the mistake.

5. Finish validating the foreign key(s) now that the data is clean:

   ```sql
   select pgpm.validate_incoming_fks('public.events');        -- returns the number newly validated
   ```

6. **Verify** it is clean:

   ```sql
   select fks_unvalidated from pgpm.status() where parent = 'public.events'::regclass;  -- expect 0
   select * from pgpm.incoming_fk_orphans('public.events');                             -- expect no rows
   ```

   The foreign key is fully valid again.

**Prevent.** The window is the gap between the cutover's drop and the re-add, and it is entirely under your
control: **close it yourself, immediately after `transmute`**, rather than waiting for a tick.

```sql
select pgpm.restore_incoming_fks('public.events');   -- then again next tick for the VALIDATE
```

The conversion moves no rows, so there is nothing to wait for: the monolith holds every referenced row,
attached, from the moment of cutover. If you also keep writes off the referencing table across those few
seconds, the window carries no risk at all. There is no later window to worry about -- nothing in a
maintenance tick suspends a restored FK again.

The one remaining way to strand a reference is data, not timing: a `regrain` that discards aged,
still-referenced sub-ranges below the retention horizon (which it only does when `archive_fn` is unset)
leaves a real orphan for the re-validate to find. Retention itself does not, since it honours whatever the
foreign key declares in its `ON DELETE` clause.

## The history is not splitting into fine partitions

**Symptom.** `pgpm.status()` shows `history_unregrained = true` and `coarse_partitions > 0` that does not
fall; queries over old data do not prune to a single partition; retention is not reclaiming old data.

**What it means.** After `transmute`, the history lives in one coarse **monolith** partition. That is a
correct, permanent state, but pruning and fine-grained retention are suspended over its span until it is
**regrained** into proper partitions. If you want fine history, regrain has either not been enabled, or it
cannot make progress yet.

**Steps.**

1. See the backlog, whether auto-regrain is on, and whether the monolith has frozen yet:

   ```sql
   select parent, coarse_partitions, history_unregrained, regrain_to from pgpm.status();
   select write_child, write_ceiling, freeze_in, coarse_frozen from pgpm.progress('public.events');
   ```

   While `write_child` is the monolith it has not frozen and nothing can split it; `freeze_in` says how
   long until it does (time grids only; an `id` grid shows the count of ids left in `freeze_margin`
   instead). `coarse_frozen > 0` means a coarse child is frozen and waiting.

2. If `regrain_to` is null, the history is intentionally coarse. To split it, either enable paced
   auto-regrain or do it by hand once the monolith has **frozen** (the frontier has moved past its upper
   bound `B`):

   ```sql
   select pgpm.set_regrain('public.events', '1 month');   -- paced: one microbatch per maintain tick
   -- or, synchronously now (atomic, one transaction; writes to the table wait until it commits):
   select pgpm.regrain_history('public.events');
   ```

3. If auto-regrain is on but `coarse_partitions` is not falling, see how far the in-flight regrain has
   got, then check why a tick is not progressing in `pgpm.log`:

   ```sql
   select regrain_child, regrain_pct_range, regrain_rows_copied, regrain_delta_pending, regrain_eta
     from pgpm.progress('public.events');
   select at, action, method from pgpm.log
    where parent_table = 'public.events'::regclass and action in ('skip_regrain', 'regrain')
    order by id desc limit 10;
   ```

   - `regrain_pct_range` climbing tick over tick is healthy even while `coarse_partitions` holds: the
     coarse child stays attached until the one atomic swap at the end. `regrain_eta` is null through the
     first sub-range, then an extrapolation from the range fraction so far.
   - A `maintain` summary of `regrain=active` means the monolith has **not frozen yet** (the current
     interval still lands in it); it will regrain once the frontier crosses `B`.
   - `regrain=copied:N` is healthy forward progress (one budget-sized copy microbatch); `regrain=swapped:K`
     is a completed regrain (K fine children attached). A `skip_regrain` log row is usually a lock-race
     deferral, and a `regrain_aged` row is a below-horizon sub-range skipped under a retention policy; both
     are normal. The exception is a `skip_regrain` whose `method` begins `pg_partition_magician: refusing to
     swap`: `retain` was loosened after the regrain had already skipped sub-ranges as aged, and the swap is
     waiting rather than dropping rows the new policy keeps. Set `retain` back and the next tick swaps, or
     `regrain_cancel` and re-run under the new policy.
   - `regrain=reconciling:N` tick after tick, with `regrain_delta_pending` not falling, means writes into
     the coarse child are outpacing the reconcile and the swap is correctly refusing to start. The table
     is consistent and reads are unaffected; raise `regrain_batch` or wait for the write burst to pass.
   - A `skip_regrain` row whose `method` reads `captured change(s) in [...] are still pending after the
     swap's residual reconcile` is the swap refusing to drop the source with changes unapplied. The tick
     rolled back whole, the source is still attached, and the next tick reconciles the backlog before
     swapping; nothing is lost. It should not recur, and one that does is worth reporting.
   - A `TRUNCATE` of the table, or of the coarse child, fails with `pg_partition_magician: cannot
     TRUNCATE ... a regrain is in flight on it` for as long as the regrain is in flight. That is
     deliberate: a truncate cannot be captured, and the swap would otherwise put every truncated row
     back. Cancel with `pgpm.regrain_cancel` first, or truncate after the swap.

4. If disk is the constraint, see [Disk is filling during a regrain](#disk-is-filling-during-a-regrain).

**Verify.**

```sql
select coarse_partitions, history_unregrained from pgpm.status() where parent = 'public.events'::regclass;
-- coarse_partitions falling toward 0; history_unregrained false once fully split
```

**Prevent.** Decide up front whether the table needs fine history. If it does, enable `set_regrain` after
`transmute` (or regrain by hand in a maintenance window). If a coarse monolith is acceptable, leave it.

## A write is refused: `no partition of relation ... found for row`

**Symptom.** The application sees

```text
ERROR:  no partition of relation "events" found for row
DETAIL:  Partition key of the failing row contains (id) = (...).
```

**What it means.** pgpm keeps **no `DEFAULT` partition**. `obtain` maintains a grid of real partitions
running `config.obtain` steps ahead of the write frontier, and a row outside that grid has nowhere to go,
so PostgreSQL refuses it. There are two ways to be outside it, and one way, for a table converted before
pgpm enforced its byte budget on names, to have no forward grid at all.

**Above the grid** -- the value is further ahead than the lookahead reaches. Check the ceiling:

```sql
select newest_bound from pgpm.status() where parent = 'public.events'::regclass;
```

Either maintenance has stalled (see below) or the write is genuinely further ahead than
`config.obtain x partition_step`. The latter is common on **id** grids, where the frontier is data-driven
and can jump: a sequence restart, a Snowflake generator, a bulk import carrying its own ids. Time grids
advance predictably and rarely hit this.

**Below the grid** -- the value is older than the retention floor, so its partition was deliberately
dropped. This is correct: retention reclaimed that range. Do not widen retention to make the write
succeed unless you actually want that data kept.

**No grid was ever built** -- the table was converted by a pgpm older than the one that refuses over-long
names. Its name was long enough that every forward cell's `<rel>_p<label>` was cut to the same 63 bytes,
the monolith took that name, and `obtain` skipped every cell as already existing, with nothing logged.
`newest_bound` sits at the monolith's `hi` while maintenance is healthy, and since the upgrade every tick
logs the refusal instead of skipping:

```sql
select parent_table, child_name from pgpm.part where attached and octet_length(child_name) = 63;
select parent_table, method, at from pgpm.log where action = 'skip_obtain' order by at desc limit 5;
```

The repair is the same for every such table: `untransmute` (a clean reverse, since every row is still in
the monolith), rename the table within the budget under
[Partition naming](reference.md#partition-naming), and `transmute` again.

**What to do.**

1. Confirm maintenance is running at all. If `pg_cron` is stopped or the table is `paused`, `obtain` is
   not extending the grid and the ceiling is frozen where it stopped:

   ```sql
   select parent, paused, newest_bound from pgpm.status();
   select jobname, active from cron.job where jobname like 'pgpm%';
   ```

2. If maintenance is healthy and you know the specific value that needs covering (a bulk import's high
   ids, say), extend the grid directly to it. Partitions are empty and creating one is pure catalog work,
   and it is bounded up front (`p_max`, default 10000) so a typo'd value is refused loudly rather than
   silently building far more than you meant. Each partition holds its locks until the call's one
   transaction ends, so a call that would fill more than half the shared lock table is refused too, with
   the number of partitions one call can create; extend in steps of that size, one call per transaction:

   ```sql
   select pgpm.extend_to('public.events', '50000000');
   ```

   If you just want more general headroom rather than a specific known value, raise the lookahead instead:

   ```sql
   select pgpm.set_obtain('public.events', 90);
   select pgpm.obtain('public.events');
   ```

3. For a one-off bulk load with known-high ids, extend before loading rather than raising the standing
   lookahead.

**Why there is no `DEFAULT` to catch these.** A refused write is loud and immediate: it names the table
and the row, and it tells you the moment the grid stops advancing. A `DEFAULT` would accept the same write
silently and leave you a backlog to find later, plus a window in which those rows sit outside the
partition that should hold them.

## Disk is filling during a regrain

**Symptom.** Free space drops while a regrain is running; `pgpm.status()` shows `inflight_partitions > 0`
for the table.

**What it means.** `regrain` **copies** the monolith's rows into new fine partitions and only drops the
source after they are swapped in, so it transiently needs roughly **2x the disk** of the range being
regrained while the copies coexist with the source. On an elastic or auto-scaling volume this is absorbed;
on a fixed volume it can be a problem if you regrain a large coarse child in one shot.

**Steps.**

1. See what is in flight, and how far along it is:

   ```sql
   select parent, coarse_partitions, inflight_partitions from pgpm.status();
   select regrain_pct_range, regrain_rows_copied, regrain_eta from pgpm.progress('public.events');
   ```

   The transient space is reclaimed at the swap, so `regrain_eta` is roughly how long until it comes back.

2. If you are disk-bound, get the transient space back now. Turning auto-regrain off abandons the run in
   flight as `regrain_cancel` would: the copies are dropped at once, the source child still holds every row,
   and only the copying already done is lost:

   ```sql
   select pgpm.set_regrain('public.events', null);   -- off: abandons the in-flight run, copies dropped
   ```

   If you would rather keep that work, leave auto-regrain on until `progress()` shows the swap (the source
   is dropped there, which reclaims the space), then turn it off before the next coarse child gets far.

3. Regrain **hierarchically** so each step's footprint stays bounded: split the monolith into coarse units
   first (for example per year), then regrain one coarse unit at a time. Each later step only needs ~2x of
   one unit, not of the whole history:

   ```sql
   -- one coarse unit, by hand (target a coarser step first, then the fine step per unit)
   select pgpm.regrain('public.events', '<monolith child name from pgpm.part>', '1 year');
   ```

4. Or acquire more disk: on a managed/elastic volume, grow it (or let auto-scaling absorb the spike), then
   resume `set_regrain`.

**Verify.**

```sql
-- free space recovers after the swap drops the source; the coarse child is gone from pgpm.part
select coarse_partitions, inflight_partitions from pgpm.status() where parent = 'public.events'::regclass;
```

**Prevent.** Before regraining a large history on a fixed volume, prearrange about 2x the headroom of the
span you will regrain, or regrain hierarchically so the transient footprint stays bounded to one unit at a
time. On an elastic volume, no special preparation is needed.

## Storage is not dropping despite a retention policy

**Symptom.** `config.retain` is set, but disk is not falling as old data ages out: aged partitions linger
past the retention horizon.

**What it means.** Retention is enforced only while maintenance runs. Two mechanisms reclaim aged data,
both driven by `maintain` on pg_cron:

- `retain()` drops whole materialized partitions older than the horizon (a `retain_drop` log row).
So retention is **best-effort**: if the table is `paused`, or if `maintain_all` is not scheduled, aged
data lingers and storage does not fall. It bounds storage only when maintenance actually runs.
(Watch the unit, too: `retain` is an **interval** for `time`/`uuidv7`/`text_time` and a **count of ids**
for `id`, subtracted from the highest id written. It is not a number of partitions: `retain => 2` on a
1000-wide id grid keeps two ids of history, which in practice is only the partition taking writes, so
size it as partitions times the grid width.
A misread puts the horizon far from where you meant it.)

Three more shapes look like this symptom but are working as designed: a `retain_batch` cap paces drops
one batch per tick, so a large aged-out backlog takes several ticks to clear (`retain_backlog` falling
tick over tick is that pacing, not a stall); a child with `config.archive_fn` set defers its own drop
until archiving actually catches up (`retain_backlog` flat with `retain_drop_failures` staying at
**zero** -- this is not a failure, just chunked archiving still in progress); and an unexpected `DROP`
failure blocks that one partition on purpose (`retain_drop_failures` climbing instead).

**Steps.**

1. Confirm the policy is set and that maintenance can act on it:

   ```sql
   select parent, paused, retain_backlog, retain_drop_failures, retain_detaching
     from pgpm.status() where parent = 'public.events'::regclass;
   select retain, retain_batch, archive_fn from pgpm.config where parent_table = 'public.events'::regclass;
   ```

   `paused = true` means maintenance is doing nothing. A flat `retain_backlog` with `retain_drop_failures`
   also flat at zero, and `archive_fn` set, means chunked archiving simply hasn't caught up yet for the
   partitions at the head of the backlog -- not a failure, just run more maintenance ticks (or check
   `pgpm.archive_ledger`/`pgpm._archive_fully_covered` for that child directly). A flat `retain_backlog`
   with `retain_drop_failures` actually **climbing** is a real failure: the reason is in the log
   (`fail_retain_drop`, `fail_retain_crossing`, `fail_retain_detach`, `fail_retain_identity`,
   `fail_archive_identity`, `fail_write_block_identity` or `fail_archive_contract` rows, `method`).

   **The three `*_identity` actions need no foreign key and no detach, so check for them first.** All
   say the same thing: a partition's name no longer resolves to the relation pgpm recorded for it
   (`method` carries the oids, and for `fail_retain_identity` which anchor disagreed). They differ
   only in which step refused, and therefore in how far the partition got:
   `fail_write_block_identity` is the write-block step declining to put its trigger on the relation
   holding the name, which also means the partition never becomes an archive candidate;
   `fail_archive_identity` is the archive step refusing to read it, rather than exporting whatever
   now holds the name and recording a coverage claim from it; `fail_retain_identity` is `retire`
   refusing to detach or drop it. Nothing was archived and nothing was dropped in any case, and a
   `fail_archive_identity` at `archive_batch`'s default of `1` also holds up that table's other
   partitions.

   Neither **ever** clears itself, which is what separates them from everything else in this list:
   there is no later tick on which the name goes back to meaning the right relation. Find out what
   took it, then either put the intended relation back under that name or clear the stale bookkeeping
   with `pgpm.forget_missing()` (if the parent itself is gone) or `delete from pgpm.part where
   parent_table = ... and child_name = ...`. Renaming a partition is safe if you update
   `pgpm.part.child_name` and `pgpm.archive_ledger.child_name` in the same transaction: a rename does
   not change an oid, so the recorded identity stays right, and the ledger matches archived chunks to
   their partition by name, so carrying it keeps the coverage attached (the guide has the three
   statements). Leaving the ledger behind does not wedge anything: the next archive tick discards the
   coverage left under the old name (logged once as `archive_coverage_reset`) and archives the
   partition again from its `lo`.

   **`fail_archive_contract` is the archive step refusing what your archive strategy returned**, not a
   problem with the partition: `config.archive_fn` answered a chunk with a `covered_hi` that was null,
   not above the chunk's `lo`, past its `hi`, or not a native value at all, and pgpm declined to record
   a coverage claim it can see is wrong. `method` names the strategy, the chunk, the value returned and
   the rule it broke. Nothing was archived and nothing was dropped. Unlike the identity refusals it does
   clear itself: nothing advanced, so every tick hands the strategy the same chunk again, and once the
   strategy is fixed (or `pgpm.set_archive_fn` points at a corrected one) archiving resumes from where
   the ledger stands. A strategy that cannot make progress on a call should raise, which shows as a
   `skip_archive` deferral, rather than return the chunk's own `lo`.

2. If anything has a foreign key **pointing at** this table, check the two failures specific to that. A
   referenced partition cannot be dropped outright; it is detached first, by a cron job.

   ```sql
   select at, action, lo, hi, method from pgpm.log
    where parent_table = 'public.events'::regclass
      and action in ('fail_retain_detach', 'fail_retain_crossing', 'fail_retain_identity',
                     'retain_detach', 'retain_crossing')
    order by id desc limit 20;
   ```

   - `fail_retain_detach` -- there is no `pgpm_detach` cron job to dispatch to. Run `pgpm.schedule()`
     once: it creates both jobs, and re-running it on an install that already has one is safe.
   - `fail_retain_crossing` -- a live row genuinely references an aged one, and that foreign key's own
     `ON DELETE` (`NO ACTION` or `RESTRICT`) refuses to let it go. `method` carries PostgreSQL's own
     error naming the constraint. This is the constraint doing its job, not a pgpm fault: remove the
     referencing rows, or change the referential action, if you meant retention to win.
   - `fail_retain_identity` -- covered in step 1, because it is not specific to a referenced
     partition. The detach-specific half is worth knowing here though: the detach travels to pg_cron
     as text naming the partition and is re-resolved in that session a tick or more later, so pgpm
     records the oid at dispatch (`pgpm.part.retiring_oid`) as well as the one recorded when the
     partition was created (`child_oid`), and refuses when the name stops resolving to **either**.
     `method` says which, so a stale dispatch and a stale catalog row are distinguishable.
   - `retain_detaching` non-zero for many ticks with none of these logged means the detach is
     dispatched but the `pgpm` job is not running: check `cron.job_run_details`.

3. Run a maintenance pass, or force the reclaim by hand:

   ```sql
   call pgpm.maintain('public.events');       -- one pass: obtain, archive, retain (and auto-regrain)
   -- or catch up now, synchronously:
   select pgpm.retain('public.events');       -- drop aged partitions now
   select pgpm.retire('public.events', 'events_p...');  -- or surgically: drop ONE eligible partition
   ```

   A referenced partition needs **two** calls with the cron detach in between, so `retain()` returning 0
   once is expected there; check `retain_detaching` rather than assuming it failed.

4. Confirm reclamation actually happened:

   ```sql
   select at, action, lo, hi, rows from pgpm.log
    where parent_table = 'public.events'::regclass and action = 'retain_drop'
    order by id desc limit 20;
   ```

**Verify.**

```sql
-- aged partitions are gone; storage falls once the drops are reclaimed
select n_partitions, retain_backlog from pgpm.status() where parent = 'public.events'::regclass;
```

**Prevent.** Keep `maintain_all` scheduled on pg_cron so aged partitions are dropped in time, and do not leave a
managed table `paused` if you rely on retention to bound storage. Retention only bounds storage while
maintenance actually runs.

## Re-transmute fails with an orphan-table error

**Symptom.** `transmute` refuses up front with an error like:

> pg_partition_magician: public.events_p2026_03 already exists as a standalone table matching this
> parent's partition naming -- most likely an orphan left by an interrupted regrain. Drop it
> (drop table public.events_p2026_03) and retry transmute.

**What it means.** A regrain builds each fine child as a **standalone** table and only `ATTACH`es it at
the swap. A standalone child has no dependency on the parent, so a `DROP TABLE <parent> CASCADE` does
**not** remove an un-attached child -- it survives the cascade. If the parent is then recreated and
re-transmuted, the new conversion would collide with that orphan by name. So `transmute` refuses when it
finds a standalone table matching the parent's child-partition naming (`<rel>_p<label>`, any label pgpm
could give a fine child, such as `events_p2026_03`, `n_p0000000000000000100`, a 20-digit id label past
10^19 or one with a `_<fraction>` tail), rather than silently adopting stale data. An in-flight child is
also tracked in `pgpm.part` with `attached = false`.

Two sibling refusals share this shape. `... already exists as a sequence matching this parent's partition
naming ...` means a relation that is not a table holds a child-partition name; the message says what kind it
is, so `drop table` is not the command. `... already exists, and transmute needs that name for the monolith
...` means a relation holds the coarse name the converted table itself will take (`<rel>_p<lo>_to_<hi>`),
typically a monolith detached from an earlier conversion of a table by that name. In every case the refusal
happens before anything is committed: no bound, no claim, the table untouched. Drop or rename the relation
the message names and retry.

**Steps.**

1. The error names the orphan. Confirm it is a leftover standalone table, not a live attached partition --
   it is a partition of no parent, and it may show in `pgpm.partitions` with `attached = false`:

   ```sql
   select inhparent::regclass from pg_inherits
    where inhrelid = 'public.events_p2026_03'::regclass;            -- expect no rows (not attached anywhere)
   select * from pgpm.partitions where child_name = 'events_p2026_03';  -- attached = false, if still tracked
   ```

2. Drop the orphan and retry:

   ```sql
   drop table public.events_p2026_03;   -- the table the error named
   -- then re-run your transmute(...) call
   ```

**Verify.**

```sql
select * from pgpm.status() where parent = 'public.events'::regclass;   -- transmute succeeded; the table is managed
```

**Prevent.** Do not `DROP`/recreate a parent mid-conversion. Let an interrupted regrain finish (its swap
attaches the fine children, so they become real partitions rather than orphans), or `untransmute` while the
conversion is still reversible, rather than dropping the parent out from under its in-flight children.

## A `from_hypertable` cutover is slow or its pre-drain will not converge

**Symptom.** Migrating a TimescaleDB hypertable with `from_hypertable`, either: `from_hypertable_cutover`
sits for a long time before (or during) its brief lock; or a hand-driven `from_hypertable_drain_delta` /
`from_hypertable_drain_appends` raises `pg_partition_magician: from_hypertable_drain_delta(...) did not
converge within N iterations` (or the cutover's best-effort pre-drain returns having left a large residual
that is then applied under the lock).

**What it means.** When `p_track_changes` is on, the cutover catch-up is the change **delta** captured
during the online copy; otherwise it is the rows appended past the copy watermark. Either backlog is drained
online, in bounded micro-batches, *before* the lock (`p_predrain`, default true), so the lock applies only a
tiny residual. Non-convergence means the workload is dirtying keys / appending faster than the micro-batch
drain clears them, so the residual never falls to the threshold within the iteration budget (`p_max_iter`).
The drain is best-effort and the under-lock pass is the correctness backstop, so the migration stays
**correct** either way -- the symptom is a *long lock* (the under-lock pass applies a big residual), not data
loss.

**Steps.**

1. See how big the backlog is (run during the online window, before cutover). For tracking, count the delta;
   for append-only, count rows past the destination watermark:

   ```sql
   -- tracking (p_track_changes => true):
   select count(*) from public.events_pgpm_delta;
   -- append-only (no tracking):
   select count(*) from public.events where created_at > (select max(created_at) from public.events_pgpm_dest);
   ```

2. Drain it down by hand, with a bigger batch, before cutting over (this is the two-phase flow -- it lets
   the backlog shrink while the source stays live):

   ```sql
   -- tracking:
   call pgpm.from_hypertable_drain_delta('public.events', 'created_at', p_batch => 200000);
   -- append-only:
   call pgpm.from_hypertable_drain_appends('public.events', 'created_at', p_batch => 200000);
   ```

3. If the workload genuinely outruns the drain, accept a larger final batch instead of chasing zero -- raise
   the threshold so the drain stops sooner and the (still bounded) remainder is applied under the lock:

   ```sql
   call pgpm.from_hypertable_drain_delta('public.events', 'created_at', p_batch => 200000, p_threshold => 100000);
   ```

   Or pause / throttle the write workload briefly, then cut over. As a last resort, raise `p_max_iter`.

4. Cut over. The cutover re-runs a best-effort pre-drain and then applies whatever residual remains under the
   lock:

   ```sql
   call pgpm.from_hypertable_cutover('public.events', 'created_at', interval '1 day', p_drain_batch => 200000, p_paused => false);
   ```

   To skip the cutover's own pre-drain (e.g. you already drained by hand and want the lock taken
   immediately), pass `p_predrain => false`.

**Verify.**

```sql
select relkind from pg_class where oid = 'public.events'::regclass;   -- 'p' = migrated to a partitioned table
select * from pgpm.status() where parent = 'public.events'::regclass; -- registered and managed
```

**Prevent.** For update/delete-heavy workloads, drive the drain in the two-phase flow (copy, let it drain,
then cutover) rather than relying on the one-shot, and size `p_drain_batch` to the write rate. Append-only
migrations rarely hit this (the backlog is structurally small -- the copy reads the current chunk last, so
it captures appends as it goes). Migrate during a quieter write window when possible.

## A managed table was dropped without `untransmute`

**Symptom.** Any of: `pgpm.status()` shows `parent_missing = true` for a row whose `parent` prints as a bare
number instead of a table name; `pgpm.log` fills with `skip_obtain` / `skip_write_block` / `skip_retain`
every tick, all giving `syntax error at or near "<number>"` as the reason; or, on a version before 0.2.0,
`pgpm.status()` raises that syntax error and returns **no rows at all** for any managed table.

**What it means.** Someone ran `DROP TABLE` on a pgpm-managed parent instead of
[`pgpm.untransmute`](reference.md#untransmute). `pgpm.config.parent_table` is a `regclass`, which carries no
dependency on the relation, so the config row survived pointing at an oid that no longer resolves. pgpm goes
on trying to manage a table that is not there. Nothing self-heals this: `untransmute` is the only thing that
deletes those rows and it cannot run against a table that is gone.

Maintenance for **other** tables is unaffected -- `maintain`'s per-step handlers absorb the error -- so this
is noise and a broken diagnostic rather than an outage. Two reasons to clear it anyway: the per-tick log
noise buries real failures, and `pg_class` oids get recycled, so a stale row is a standing chance of pgpm
one day believing it manages an unrelated table that lands on that oid.

**Steps.**

1. Confirm it, and see which tables are affected:

   ```sql
   select parent, parent_missing, n_partitions, retain_backlog from pgpm.status();
   ```

   `parent_missing = true` is the flag; `parent` prints as the raw oid, which is all that is left of the
   table's identity. `retain_backlog` is null for those rows, because the retention horizon is read from the
   relation.

2. Clear the dead state:

   ```sql
   select * from pgpm.forget_missing();
   -- parent_oid | partitions_forgotten | orphan_tables
   ```

   No argument, on purpose: it can only ever match rows whose relation is already gone, so it cannot touch a
   live managed table. It is a no-op if nothing is missing.

3. **Check `orphan_tables`.** Non-empty means partitions survived their parent's `DROP` and **still hold
   data**. That happens when a partition was detached first -- which is exactly the state a referenced
   partition's retirement sits in between the cron detach and the completing drop (see
   [retention with an incoming foreign key](guide.md#retention-with-an-incoming-foreign-key)).
   `forget_missing` deliberately leaves these alone. Decide per table:

   ```sql
   select count(*) from public.events_p0000000000000000000;   -- from orphan_tables
   -- keep it (rename it out of the way), or, once you are sure:
   -- drop table public.events_p0000000000000000000;
   ```

**Verify.**

```sql
select count(*) from pgpm.status() where parent_missing;   -- expect 0
select * from pgpm.forget_missing();                       -- expect no rows
```

The per-tick `skip_*` noise stops with the next maintenance run.

**Prevent.** Use `pgpm.untransmute(parent)` to stop managing a table -- it reverses the conversion and
deletes pgpm's rows for you. If you genuinely want the table gone, `untransmute` first, then `DROP TABLE`.
Note `untransmute` only works while the conversion is still reversible (before any real partition beyond the
monolith exists); past that, drop the table and run `pgpm.forget_missing()`.
