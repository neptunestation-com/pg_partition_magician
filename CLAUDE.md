## Assertions that pass for the wrong reason

The recurring defect in this repo is not a failing test. It is a **passing** one that would
also pass against broken code. It has shipped six times. Almost every contract here is a
negative (does not block, does not scan, does not lose rows, no lock held), and every
negative is satisfied by an execution where nothing happened at all, so absence-of-defect
and absence-of-setup look identical unless you separate them deliberately.

- **Pair every negative or bounded assertion with a liveness witness.** If the claim is
  "X did not happen", also assert that the conditions for X were present. The guards in
  `bench/` do this (`the probe caught the validation scan in progress`, `the tick did the
  work that takes the lock`) and it is what caught a probe that had starved the very step
  it was measuring.
- **Prove the guard discriminates, and keep the proof.** Green on correct code is not
  evidence. Every guard in `bench/` has a mutation in `bench/mutations/` that puts its
  defect back, and `./test.sh discriminate` requires the guard to FAIL against it. Add a
  mutation with the guard, in the same commit; a guard without one is unverified.
- **Never prefix-match `pgpm.log.action`.** Non-success events are prefixed
  (`skip_drain`, `fail_retain_drop`), never suffixed, precisely so `drain%` cannot match a
  deferral. Keep it that way, and prefer exact values in assertions regardless.
- **Assert identity, not cardinality; keep fixtures asymmetric.** A row-count check is
  invariant under compensating errors: a lost INSERT and a resurrected DELETE cancelled
  and the test passed under a real data-loss bug. Say *which* rows, and build fixtures
  where the expected effects cannot cancel (2 in, 1 out, not 1 and 1).
- **A concurrency probe perturbs what it measures.** Three rules learned the hard way: give
  each observation its own transaction (locks are held to transaction end, and a `DO`
  block is one transaction, so a polling loop pins its lock and starves the code under
  test); check your instrument's cost against the window's width before trusting it
  (~100 ms per `docker exec` sample cannot land inside a ~400 ms scan; poll server-side);
  and remember that `pg_stat_activity` is snapshotted per transaction, so a poll that runs
  inside one function or `DO` block must call `pg_stat_clear_snapshot()` every iteration
  or it never sees the backend leave and burns its whole budget (tests/269 under the
  parallel runner, #1045).
- **Counters flush at transaction end.** `pg_stat_all_tables` scan counters read 0 when
  sampled inside the transaction that produced them, so the sample has to come from a
  later transaction than the work it measures. Those assertions belong in a `bench/` shell
  harness, which runs every tick in its own transaction, alongside the lock guards, which
  need a second concurrent session that one pgTAP file cannot give them.
- **Pin every `throws_*` around a committing procedure.** pgTAP runs the statement under
  test inside a function, so a procedure that does NOT refuse dies at its first COMMIT there
  with 2D000 and rolls back into the state a refusal leaves. `throws_ok(sql, NULL, desc)`
  accepts that: the three-argument overload reads a second argument that is not five octets,
  NULL included, as the message, so it pins nothing. Pin the message with `throws_like`, or
  the SQLSTATE with the four-argument `throws_ok(sql, 'P0001', NULL, desc)`.
  `bench/throws_pinned.sh` fails the perf track on any assertion of that shape that would
  also accept the 2D000.

## `_q` means the identifiers are already quoted

A plpgsql local ending in `_q` holds text whose identifiers have already been through
`quote_ident` (usually `string_agg(quote_ident(attname), ', ')` over a column list). Splice it
with `%s`. `%I` over it would quote it a second time, into garbage. A local without the suffix is
raw and takes `%I`.

The suffix exists because the two are indistinguishable at the call site: `format(..., v_cols, ...)`
reads the same whether `v_cols` was pre-quoted or someone forgot `%I` (issue #409). It is not
advisory. `scripts/check_quoted_splices.py` fails CI when a quote-derived `text` local lacks the
suffix, AND when a suffixed one is assigned from something that quotes nothing, so reading the name
is worth something. Run it (and its `--selftest`) before pushing a change to any `install.sql`.

Two boundaries worth knowing, both deliberate. The rule is about the VALUE, not its destination, so
a quoted list that only ever reaches an error message is marked too: that keeps the rule
exception-free, and an allowlist is the thing that rots. And a fragment assembled OUT of `_q`
pieces (`v_elig := format('%1$s >= %2$L', v_ctl_q, v_lo_lit)`) is NOT required to be marked -- it is
a predicate, not an identifier list, and the `_q` names it is built from already show its
provenance. Widening past that puts the suffix on nearly every local, at which point it marks
nothing.

## `./test.sh all` is not what CI runs

`all` means all four PostgreSQL **versions**, not all tracks. The `timescale`, `observe`,
`archive`, `perf`, `discriminate`, `locktrace` and `lockview` tracks each need their own
image or service and are skipped, so a green `./test.sh all` does **not** predict a green CI.

Use **`./test.sh ci`** before pushing anything that touches `pgpm_core/install.sql`, which
every one of those tracks installs. It runs each track as a child invocation, so each gets
its own `set -e` and behaves exactly as CI's separate jobs do, and it runs them all rather
than stopping at the first failure.

Two tracks are the exception, and they say so rather than hiding it: `locktrace` and
`lockview` both need eBPF (a privileged container and the host's own kernel headers), so
`ci` runs them on Linux and prints `SKIPPED` for them anywhere else, never folding either
into the `PASS`. The guard is on the kernel alone, so a Linux box that cannot actually
trace FAILS rather than skipping. A skip is covered by CI rather than by nothing:
`.github/workflows/locktrace.yml` runs the tracer's track on every PR touching the tracer,
the guard, the mutations or the core install, and `.github/workflows/lockview.yml` runs the
renderer's capture track on every PR touching a lock-view file. But a Mac `ci` run still has
not verified them itself, so read that skip the way the archive round trip below teaches you
to read a green `./test.sh all`: the PR's own job is what covers you, not the run you just
watched.

This has already cost a round trip: making `pgpm.transmute` a procedure broke
`tests/archive/fixtures.sql`, whose `mk_archive_table` was a function calling it (a
function cannot call a committing procedure at all). `./test.sh all` stayed green from end
to end and only the PR's archive job caught it.

## Lint Markdown before pushing docs

CI runs a `Markdown` job (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`,
`DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2-action@v16`) over `**/*.md` using the rules in
`.markdownlint.json`. `Markdown` feeds the `Lint summary` check `main` requires, so a red one keeps
the PR out of the merge queue; lint locally first.
the check green.

- **Match CI's linter version.** The action pins markdownlint **v0.34.0**. Run
  `markdownlint-cli2@0.13.0` locally (it bundles v0.34.0). A newer markdownlint enforces
  rules CI does not (e.g. MD060) and sends you chasing phantom errors.
- **Scope to the files CI lints.** CI checks out only committed files, so it never sees
  the gitignored `bench/results/` scratch or other untracked `.md`. Lint the tracked set
  and do NOT reformat gitignored scratch.
- **Check, then optionally fix:**

  ```bash
  npx -y markdownlint-cli2@0.13.0 $(git ls-files '*.md' \
    | grep -v '^frozen/postgresql_online_partition_migration_summary.md$' | tr '\n' ' ')
  # add --fix to auto-correct the structural rules (MD022/MD032/MD012/MD004/MD009)
  ```

  Lint the TRACKED set by name. Bare filenames work fine, and a `**/*.md` glob does not,
  because the glob walks gitignored scratch that CI never checks out. Measured 2026-09-17:
  the glob linted 68 files and reported 76 errors, every one of them from vendored markdown
  inside a venv, against 26 files and 0 errors for the tracked set. An `!<path>` exclusion
  list cannot keep up, because it needs a new entry for every scratch directory anyone
  creates, and a missing entry shows up as a confident failure in a file CI cannot see.
- **`-` or `+` at the start of a wrapped line** reads as a stray list item (MD004/MD032).
  Reword instead of introducing an em dash (house style: no em dashes anywhere).

## How PRs land

`main` requires three summary checks (`Test Summary`, `Lint summary`, `Perf summary`), resolved review
threads, and an up-to-date branch, and a ruleset puts a **merge queue** in front of it. `gh pr merge
--squash` therefore enqueues rather than merges: GitHub builds `main` plus the queued PRs, runs every
workflow on that exact tree (`merge_group` has no path filter, so the perf, archive and eBPF tracks all
run there whatever the PR touched), and merges the group only if it is green, splitting and retrying a
red one. Do not rebase-and-rerun a batch by hand; the queue does it once per group. A PR whose own
checks are red or whose threads are unresolved cannot be queued. The queue needs an organization-owned
repository, which is one reason this one lives under `neptunestation-com`.

## An unresolved review thread blocks a merge invisibly

`gh pr view` reports `mergeable: MERGEABLE` and `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` at the same
time, with every check green and nothing on the PR page to explain it. The usual cause is
an unresolved `chatgpt-codex-connector` review thread. Those threads do not appear in
`gh pr checks`, so query them directly:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='{repository(owner:"neptunestation-com",name:"pg_partition_magician"){
  pullRequest(number:NNN){reviewThreads(first:50){pageInfo{hasNextPage}
  nodes{isResolved path comments(first:1){nodes{databaseId body}}}}}}}'
```

`pageInfo{hasNextPage}` is not decoration. `first:50` truncates silently, so on a PR with more
threads the query reports nothing unresolved while one sits past the boundary, and you are left
with a confidently unexplained `BLOCKED`. If `hasNextPage` is true, page through with an
`$endCursor` variable and `--paginate` before believing a clean result.

Read what they raise and fix or rebut it, then reply on the thread and resolve it. Never
`--admin` past them, and never resolve one unread to clear the path: on #394 all three were
real, two of them were defects in our own spec rather than in the code, and one was a
docstring claiming a safety property that nothing enforced.
