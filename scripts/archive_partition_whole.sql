-- Operator utility, not a pgpm feature: archives the OLDEST currently write-blocked,
-- not-yet-archive-covered partition of a managed table in exactly one call -- one file for that
-- partition -- bypassing config.archive_byte_budget/archive_batch's chunker entirely.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS. pgpm.maintain()'s automatic archiver (pgpm._archive_step) paces itself by
-- estimating how many rows fit config.archive_byte_budget and archiving that many per tick, which
-- is the right default (a large partition archived as one giant operation risks statement_timeout),
-- but sizing that budget to land on "one file per partition" requires measuring the table's real
-- per-row compression ratio and multiplying by its row count -- fiddly, and easy to get wrong in
-- either direction (too small: many small files; too large: back to the statement_timeout risk the
-- chunker exists to avoid). This sidesteps the sizing problem: instead of tuning a byte budget and
-- hoping it lands on the partition's actual size, it calls the table's configured archive_fn
-- directly on the partition's own [lo, hi) -- one partition, one call, one file -- and leaves only
-- statement_timeout to size (see below).
--
-- ONE PARTITION PER CALL, DELIBERATELY -- NOT A LOOP OVER THE WHOLE BACKLOG. An earlier version of
-- this script looped over every eligible partition inside one PROCEDURE, committing between each,
-- on the theory that the commit would give each partition its own fresh statement_timeout window.
-- That theory is wrong, verified directly: statement_timeout is enforced cumulatively across a
-- whole top-level CALL, and does NOT reset at an internal COMMIT (proved with a 3-segment,
-- 1.5s-each test procedure under a 2s statement_timeout -- it failed at 2.0s total, not 4.5s, even
-- though each individual segment was well under the timeout on its own). A procedure that loops
-- over N partitions internally is exactly as exposed to statement_timeout as if it had no commits
-- at all; the commits only protect against OTHER things (a long-held lock, an aborted transaction
-- losing more than necessary), not against the timeout accumulating.
--
-- The actual fix: this is a FUNCTION that processes exactly the single oldest eligible partition
-- and returns. To drain a backlog of several partitions, call it repeatedly -- each invocation is a
-- genuinely separate top-level statement, and only a separate top-level statement actually gets a
-- fresh statement_timeout clock. Options for repeating it:
--   - by hand: run the SELECT again, read the returned status, repeat until it says nothing is left.
--   - psql's \watch, which re-issues a query as a new statement each time (waits for one to finish
--     before starting the next, so calls never overlap):
--       select pgpm_archive_next_partition_whole('myschema.mytable'::regclass) \watch 5
--   - a shell loop invoking `psql -c "select ..."` repeatedly -- each psql invocation is its own
--     connection, trivially a fresh statement_timeout each time.
--
-- SAFE TO RE-RUN, AND SAFE ALONGSIDE maintain(). Resumes from wherever pgpm.archive_ledger's
-- coverage of the chosen partition already left off (the same watermark pgpm._next_archive_chunk
-- itself reads), not always from the partition's own lo -- so if maintain()'s own byte-budget
-- chunker already made partial progress on it (normal, not a conflict), this picks up from there
-- instead of re-archiving already-covered rows or hitting archive_ledger's (parent_table, lo)
-- primary key. Returns a plain status message when nothing is eligible, rather than an error, so
-- repeated calls are always safe to make (e.g. from \watch) without checking state first.
--
-- STATEMENT_TIMEOUT IS THE ONE THING LEFT TO SIZE, AND IT'S ON YOU: pgpm never manages
-- statement_timeout itself. Size it from a real measured single-partition archive time, not a
-- guess. A partition too large to finish inside it (or too large for Parquet's own ~1 GiB bytea
-- ceiling -- the whole file is built in memory before upload) reports a partial result and needs
-- another call, or a smaller-than-"whole-partition" approach instead (config.archive_byte_budget's
-- ordinary chunking).
--
-- Requires pgpm_core (any version that ships pgpm._run_archive_strategy/_is_write_blocked/
-- _archive_fully_covered/_native_type -- these predate this script, not new in any particular
-- release), plus pgpm.part.child_oid for the identity check below (issue #421; added after this
-- script, so an older core needs that check removed along with the column reference). Not part of pgpm_core/install.sql and never will be without a real feature proposal
-- and its own issue/PR -- this is scratch space for an operator to paste into a session and run,
-- not a shipped, versioned function.
--
-- Usage:
--   \i scripts/archive_partition_whole.sql          -- defines the function, once per session
--   set statement_timeout = '...';                  -- sized from a real measured single-partition archive time
--   select pgpm_archive_next_partition_whole('myschema.mytable'::regclass);   -- repeat until it says nothing is left
