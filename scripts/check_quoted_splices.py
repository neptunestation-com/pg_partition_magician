"""Enforce the `_q` marker on already-quoted SQL fragments. Run by CI (the `Quoted splices` lint job).

WHY THIS EXISTS (issue #409, from the #346 audit). Several functions here build a comma-joined SQL
fragment out of pieces that are already individually `quote_ident`'d, then splice the whole
already-quoted fragment into a larger dynamic query with a bare `%s`:

    select string_agg(quote_ident(attname), ', ' order by attnum) into v_cols_q from pg_attribute ...
    execute format('insert into %I.%I (%s) select %s from ...', v_nsp, v_child, v_cols_q, v_cols_q, ...)

`%s` is CORRECT there and `%I` would be a bug -- `%I` over an already-quoted string double-quotes it
into garbage, and over a comma-joined list it would quote the commas into the identifier as
well. The problem was never the code; it was that the call site looked
identical either way. Nothing at `format(..., v_cols, ...)` distinguished "already quoted, `%s` on
purpose" from "raw identifier, someone forgot `%I`", so a later edit could swap one for the other in
any of these functions and nothing would look wrong in review.

The `_q` suffix makes the invariant visible where it is used. These two checks keep the suffix
honest in both directions, so that reading it is worth something:

  CHECK 1  a text variable assigned from an identifier-quoting expression MUST end in `_q`.
           Catches the fourth copy of the pattern arriving unmarked -- which is the specific way
           #409 expected this to go wrong.
  CHECK 2  a text variable ending in `_q` MUST be assigned from one. Catches the name outliving its
           value: a refactor that leaves the suffix behind on something no longer quoted is a worse
           outcome than never having marked it, because now the `%s` beside it reads as deliberate.

SCOPE, deliberately narrow. "Identifier-quoting" means the expression itself calls `quote_ident`, or
`format`s with a `%I` (or its positional form `%3$I`), or calls one of QUOTING_HELPERS. A fragment
assembled OUT of `_q` pieces --
`v_elig := format('%1$s >= %2$L', v_ctl_q, v_lo_lit)` -- is not required to be marked: it is a
predicate, not an identifier list, and its provenance is already legible in the `_q` names it is
built from. Widening this to "any pre-built SQL fragment" would put the suffix on nearly every local
in the file, at which point it marks nothing.

Only `text` locals are considered, which is why the declare blocks are parsed at all: `v_child :=
format('%I.%I', v_nsp, p_child)::regclass` quotes identifiers on its way to an OID, and an OID is not
a fragment anyone can splice wrong. Every DECLARE section of a body is read, a nested block's as well
as the top level's (#1004: a quoted list declared in a nested block was never typed, so never checked).
