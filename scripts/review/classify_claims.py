"""Run every claim's reproduction against the review tree AND the pristine commit, and classify it
(docs/adversarial-review.md, "A pass, step by step", step 6). This is the mechanical half of
verification; no model is involved. The verifier agent reads this file's output and only then tries to
disprove the candidates.

Claims directory layout (one directory per claim, grouped by finder):

  <claims>/<finder>/<claim-id>/claim.json      {"id": "F3-07", "finder": "F3", "tier": 1,
                                                 "file": "pgpm_core/install.sql", "line": 4671,
                                                 "lens": "concurrency", "scenario": "one line",
                                                 "repro": "repro.sql",            # or repro.sh
                                                 "install": ["pgpm_core/install.sql"],   # default
                                                 "fixtures": false,               # fixtures/demo.sql
                                                 "container": "pgpm_test-archive"}  # optional; default --container
  <claims>/<finder>/<claim-id>/repro.sql | repro.sh
  <claims>/<finder>/<claim-id>/repro.verified.sql | repro.verified.sh   # optional, written by the verifier

A verifier that had to change the fixture or the assertions stores its rebuilt reproduction beside the
original as repro.verified.sql (or .sh). When one is present it is the reproduction that runs, here and in
the closure run against the fixed main, and each output record names the file in "repro_used". Every
reproduction must hold at least one `LIVENESS:` assertion (a premise check); one without is invalid_repro
and is not run, because a negative with no liveness witness also passes when nothing happened at all.

The reproduction contract. Each run gets a FRESH database in the harness container with the tree under
test installed (every file in "install", piped through psql, so the tree need not be mounted).
  repro.sql  is piped into `psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1`. The defect is PRESENT ("fails") when psql exits
             non-zero or any output line begins with `not ok` (pgTAP is fine; create the extension in
             the file).
  repro.sh   runs on the host with PSQL (a command prefix that connects to the fresh database), TREE
             (the tree under test), DB and CONTAINER in the environment. Non-zero exit means "fails".

Classification, from the two runs:
  seed_hit        fails on the review tree, not on the pristine commit: the finder found a seed. It is
                  attributed to the nearest seed in the same file (from the sealed record).
  candidate       fails on both: a real defect until the verifier disproves it.
  not_reproduced  fails on neither: dropped.
  inverted        fails on the pristine commit only. Should not happen; look at the reproduction.
  invalid_repro   the reproduction's own LIVENESS/GUARD/fixture checks failed on the review tree, so it
                  never reached the defect and proves nothing, or it holds no `LIVENESS:` assertion at
                  all (not run); back to the finder.
  not_run         the tree could not be installed in the claim's container (an environment problem, not
                  the claim's): fix the environment or the claim's "container" and re-run.
