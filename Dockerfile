# purpose: the RUN above builds pg_cron and pgTAP from source for every image in the matrix, and
# appending to it would invalidate that cache for all four to serve one optional track.
# bcc is the ONLY addition beyond debug symbols. This layer used to install pg-lock-tracer, four
# Python libraries it needed, and a script that patched two places in its source; all of that is gone
# (#389). bench/lock_probe.py is ~40 lines of BPF C we own, it filters in the kernel, and it needs

# compose service, so the probe is edited and run straight from the checkout.

# LockRelationOid is exported in .dynsym, but CommitTransaction is not. A build id identifies ONE
# build, so an unpinned install that floated a point release ahead would resolve nothing and the
# probe would attach nothing -- a guard reading an empty stream and concluding the locks it watched
# for never happened. Pinning turns that into a build failure instead.
