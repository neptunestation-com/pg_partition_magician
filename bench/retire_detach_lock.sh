# Guard retirement of a REFERENCED partition against blocking the MANAGED PARENT (issue #268).
# Run by CI (`./test.sh perf`).
#
# THE BAR (issue #263's acceptance rule): a blocking lock may last milliseconds, but it must never last
# a duration coupled to data size.
#
# Retiring a partition that an incoming foreign key references cannot be a bare DROP: PostgreSQL
# refuses that on a pure catalog dependency, which is the wedge #268 is about. It has to DETACH first.
# The tempting way to write that is a plain `ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION` from inside retire(),
# and it is wrong for a reason no functional test would catch, because the outcome is identical:
#
#   ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION               AccessExclusiveLock on the MANAGED PARENT, ~1.5 s
#                                                  at 8M referencing rows; a concurrent read of the
#                                                  parent dies with 55P03
#   ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION CONCURRENTLY  ShareUpdateExclusiveLock; reads and writes proceed
#
# The duration is set by the size of the REFERENCING table -- a table pgpm does not own and did not
# choose -- because the detach must scan it to prove no row still references the partition. So the
# blocking form makes retention stall the very table pgpm exists to keep online, for as long as
# somebody else's table is big. Measured: 159 ms against 2M referencing rows, 420 ms against 8M, and
# 343 ms even when the partition being detached holds only 10 rows.
#
# PostgreSQL refuses to run the concurrent form from a function, a procedure or a DO block, so pgpm
# cannot issue it at all: it dispatches it to pg_cron, which runs it as a top-level statement in its
# own session. tests/78 owns that handoff (does pgpm ask cron for the right statement?). THIS guard
# owns the consequence an operator feels, and deliberately does not involve cron: the background
# session below runs the detach at the top level exactly as the cron worker would, and the probe
# asserts the parent stayed usable while it did.
#
# The assertion is what a live application sees: plain SELECTs and INSERTs on the PARENT, with a
# lock_timeout far shorter than the scan, must never time out. 50 ms against a ~500 ms pre-fix hold, so
# neither verdict rides on a close call.
#
# Usage: retire_detach_lock.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# The install path defaults to the real one; bench/discriminate.sh passes a MUTANT copy instead, to
# prove this guard actually fails when the defect is present.

# COMMIT after every observation. Locks are held to transaction end and a DO block is ONE transaction,
# so a probe that just loops pins its own AccessShare on the parent and blocks the very DETACH it is
# trying to observe, which would make the run prove nothing. Learned on bench/maintain_lock.sh.
#
# pg_stat_activity is read once per transaction and then frozen (the documented snapshot). The COMMIT
# after every turn of the wait loop below therefore does double duty: it releases the probe's own lock
# (the point just made) AND ends the transaction, so the next turn reads a fresh view and the loop is a
# poll that can wait. Measured on PG 15 (#713): the same loop in one transaction never saw the tick start
# in 400 turns; with a COMMIT per turn it saw it on the second. Do not fold the loop into one transaction.
