# Run tests/archive/db/17_sigv4_wall_clock_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_archive/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. Test 17 is a plain pgTAP file and the archive track already runs it, so
# on correct code this script adds nothing. What it adds is the standing proof that the file
# DISCRIMINATES. Its defect assertions say "the late stamp is later than the transaction start", and
# a file whose stand-in recorded nothing, or whose transaction never aged, would satisfy a weaker form
# of that for the wrong reason. The file pins both with witnesses of its own, but nothing re-checks
# that those witnesses would fail if the clock they guard were swapped back. Pointing the same file at
# a mutant checks that on every CI run, instead of once by hand in a commit message.
#
# The mutation it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   sigv4_transaction_start_stamp -- both signers read now() again for x-amz-date and the credential
#                                    scope, the pre-#520 shape exactly: every request a transaction
#                                    makes carries the transaction's start time, and one made past
#                                    S3's 15-minute skew window is refused with RequestTimeTooSkewed
#
# Usage: archive_sigv4_wall_clock.sh <container> <db> [archive install.sql]
# Needs the archive image (pgsql-http + pgtap + pg_prove) AND MinIO on the same compose network: the
# file's control assertion signs one real PUT. run_archive creates the bucket before any test runs;
# run_discriminate does not, so it is created here too, idempotently and the same way (a SigV4 PUT from
# the curl image; 200 is created, 409 is already there), after waiting for MinIO to report ready.
