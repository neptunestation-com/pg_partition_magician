# Run tests/timescale/db/60_from_hypertable_copy_rerun_by_record_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_hypertable/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant (issue #1083).
#
# The file is plain pgTAP and the timescale track runs it already; this wrapper is the standing proof that
# its assertions DISCRIMINATE. The subject is how a re-run of from_hypertable_copy finds the previous copy it
# replaces: by the oids pgpm.scratch recorded, wherever those objects live now, never by the names this copy
# mints in the hypertable's current schema. By name, after ALTER TABLE <hypertable> SET SCHEMA (the move the
# cutover's 'run from_hypertable_copy first' follows), a tracking re-run dies raw 42710 on the capture
# trigger the table carried with it, and either re-run leaves the previous copy, delta and function behind,
# unrecorded, with the old capture still firing after a re-run without tracking.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py), one per object the re-run replaces:
#   hypertable_copy_rerun_capture_by_name -- the previous capture function is looked up by its minted name
#   hypertable_copy_rerun_delta_by_name   -- the previous delta is dropped only under its minted name
#   hypertable_copy_rerun_dest_by_name    -- the previous copy is dropped only under its minted name
#
# Usage: hypertable_copy_rerun_by_record.sh <container> <db> [pgpm_hypertable/install.sql]
# Runs on the TIMESCALE track's container (supabase/postgres + TimescaleDB), which is why its mutations sit
# in MUTATION_TRACK=timescale. That image does not trust the local socket, so every psql call goes over TCP
# (see run_timescale). run_timescale also runs it against the real install, so a harness broken enough to
# fail against everything cannot read as discriminating.
