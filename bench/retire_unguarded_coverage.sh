#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that its #564 assertions DISCRIMINATE. The load-bearing ones in part A are negatives
# ("retire() did not drop it", "row 500 is still live"), and a negative is equally satisfied by a
# retire() that never drops anything, which is the failure mode this repo has shipped six times. The
# file pins that with liveness witnesses of its own (the stale watermark still reading as full coverage
# right before the call, the block really gone, row 500 really in the partition), with part B, where a
# covered child whose block never left IS dropped, and with the end of part A, where the monolith is
# dropped once archiving has restarted from lo; but nothing re-checks that those witnesses would fail
# if the discard they guard were removed. Pointing the same file at a mutant is what checks that,
# every CI run, instead of once by hand in a commit message.
#
# TWO mutations are required to fail against it, and neither is redundant: each is a different
# plausible way to get this wrong.
#   retire_trusts_unguarded_coverage  -- the discard removed from retire(), so a direct call re-blocks
#                                        the child and reads the stale watermark as full coverage.
#                                        Pre-#564 behaviour exactly.
#   retire_coverage_check_after_block -- the discard kept, but asked AFTER the block is re-installed,
#                                        so "is it blocked?" is always yes and nothing is discarded.
