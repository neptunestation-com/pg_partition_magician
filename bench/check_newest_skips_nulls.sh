# Run tests/200_check_newest_skips_nulls_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of pgpm_core/install.sql, so that
# bench/discriminate.sh can show the file catches the defect its mutation puts back:
# check_uuidv7 and check_text_time read the column's maximum with ORDER BY ... DESC LIMIT 1, and DESC sorts
# NULLs first, so one NULL in the column made newest_decoded and newest_in_future null while a row years
# ahead was present (#734). The file is the acceptance test; this wrapper exists so the mutation has a guard
# the discriminate track can run against the mutant, in the shape of bench/transmute_future_maximum.sh.
#
# Runs on the plain core image (pgtap and pg_prove). TAP_GUARD_TEST_FILE overrides the test file's path
# inside the container, for a worktree mounted somewhere other than /repo. The file builds its own fixtures,
# so fixtures/demo.sql is not loaded.
