# Guard the in-place upgrade: re-running install.sql over an OLDER install must leave a database
# structurally identical to a fresh install, with its managed tables and their data intact.
# Run by CI (`./test.sh perf`, and `./test.sh discriminate` proves it catches its defect).
#
# THE DEFECT. install.sql IS the upgrade path for the install.sql channel: operators re-run the file
# over a live database. Fresh installs get every column from the `create table` bodies, but an EXISTING
# database only gets a new column if install.sql also carries an
# `alter table ... add column if not exists` line for it. Those backfill lines are hand-maintained,
# and nothing enforces them. Add a column to a `create table` body, forget the backfill line, and every
# test in the suite still passes: the whole pgTAP suite installs FRESH, one database per file, so it
# never exercises an upgrade at all. The break lands only on an operator who already had pgpm
# installed, which is to say on the only people who are not evaluating it.
#
# WHY A SHELL HARNESS. Two separate databases (a fresh oracle and an upgraded one) and two runs of
# install.sql against one of them. pgTAP gives one database per file and wraps it in a transaction, and
# install.sql cannot be run from inside SQL at all.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS, and why each one is load-bearing:
#
#   1. LIVENESS WITNESS, and the one this guard would be worthless without: after the degrade step, the
#      columns really are gone. Every later assertion is of the form "the upgrade restored X", and all
#      of them pass trivially against a degrade that silently did nothing (a renamed column, a typo in
#      the DROP list). This asserts the conditions for the defect were present before looking for it.
#   2. The pgpm catalog after the upgrade is IDENTICAL to a fresh install of the same code: every
#      column of every table and view, with its type. This is the assertion the mutation breaks.
#      And, separately and BY NAME, every routine in schema pgpm: name, identity arguments, kind and
#      result type. `create or replace` across a changed argument list creates a second overload
#      rather than replacing the first (issue #441), and when the new argument has a default the old
#      call shape matches both and fails with "is not unique". This origin, a degraded FRESH install,
#      can never carry an old signature to leave behind, so this comparison cannot catch a missed drop
#      line here; bench/upgrade_from_release.sh upgrades a real released artifact for that. It is
#      still made here so that any routine-level drift an upgrade does leave is a named difference in
#      this guard's output rather than something folded silently into the column hash.
#   3. A backfilled column's VALUE, where restoring the column empty is not good enough (issue #421).
#      pgpm.part.child_oid is what the archive step checks a candidate's name against, and a null one
#      reads as unanchored -- so an upgrade that recreated the column and populated nothing would
#      leave every partition an existing install already had permanently unprotected, with assertion
#      2 perfectly green. Checked BY IDENTITY: each row's child_oid must be the oid its OWN name
#      resolves to, so a backfill writing one plausible oid everywhere fails too.
#   4. Data survived BY IDENTITY, not by count. The fixture is asymmetric on purpose (3 inserted, 1
#      deleted, 2 surviving) so that a lost insert and a resurrected delete cannot cancel out into a
#      row count that still looks right.
#   5. Registration survived: the config row still names the same control column and step, so the
#      upgrade did not quietly reset the managed table's settings to defaults.
#   6. The upgrade was RECORDED: pgpm.installed holds two rows, the second one this version. Distinct
#      from 2: it separates "the file ran to the end" from "the schema happens to look right".
#   7. LIVENESS WITNESS: the machine still runs afterwards. maintain_obtain() (issue #347 split obtain
#      out of maintain()/maintain_all(), so this is now the call that mints partitions) on the table
#      that existed BEFORE the upgrade mints a new partition, named. A structurally perfect install
#      that can no longer obtain is not an upgrade anyone wants, and every assertion above it is
#      satisfied by a database that merely sits there.
#
# AND TWO PRECONDITIONS ON DEGRADE_COLS ITSELF, before any of that, running in OPPOSITE directions.
# The list is hardcoded and has to be (see the comment on it below), so something has to stop it
# rotting, and one direction does not: "every listed column exists in a fresh install" catches the
# list naming a column the product has DROPPED, while "every backfilled column is in the list"
# catches the product GAINING one the list forgot. Drift only ever goes the second way -- every new
# column is an opportunity to forget -- and for a long time only the first check existed, which is
# how the list came to sit at 15 entries against 25 backfill lines with nothing reporting anything
# (issue #417). Ten backfill lines were exercised by nobody, including the two that carry #405's
# claim that a crashed transmute stays reapable.
#
# Usage: upgrade_in_place.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# The install path defaults to the real one; bench/discriminate.sh passes a MUTANT copy instead, to
# prove this guard actually fails when the defect is present.
