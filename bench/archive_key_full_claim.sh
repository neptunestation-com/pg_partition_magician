# Run tests/archive/db/40_archive_key_full_claim_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_archive/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. Test 40 is a plain pgTAP file and the archive track already runs it, so on
# correct code this script adds nothing. What it adds is the standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES.
# Its contract (issue #890, the "Archive object keys" bullet) is that an export's key and a chunk's key
# never name one object: archive.object_key_owner claims a key's BASE, and the export of a relation named
# <table>_<stem> spells a chunk key of <table> under a base of its own, so the key is claimed WHOLE as well
# (archive.object_key_claim) and a writer that finds it another's takes the oid shape, or is refused. A run
# in which the export never ran, or wrote a key nobody had written, satisfies "the chunk object is intact"
# too, so the file pins each write with witnesses (every key absent before its PUT, the chunk retired so
# its object is the only copy, the export's own object at its own exact key) and with identities (each
# object's rows as id:payload, the compressed chunk byte for byte, each claim's relation and kind).
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py), one per site of the fix:
#   archive_object_key_whole_unclaimed -- archive._owned_key claims the base only, the defect the issue
#                                         reported (parts A to D)
#   archive_ndjson_gz_outside_claim    -- the NDJSON transport appends `.gz` after the claim, so a
#                                         compressed chunk's claim does not name its object (part C)
#   archive_object_key_claim_unseeded  -- install claims no whole key from pgpm.archive_ledger (part E)
#
# Usage: archive_key_full_claim.sh <container> <db> [archive install.sql]
# Needs the archive image (pgsql-http + pgtap + pg_prove) AND MinIO on the same network: the file PUTs
# NDJSON and gzip objects through maintain() and archive.to_s3. run_archive creates the bucket before any
# test runs; run_discriminate does not, so it is created here too, idempotently and the same way (a SigV4
# PUT from the curl image; 200 is created, 409 is already there), after waiting for MinIO to report ready.
