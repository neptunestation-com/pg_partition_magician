# bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its two central assertions are negatives -- "no tick
# deferred the regrain with an error", "no tick deferred the archive step with an error" -- and a
# negative is equally satisfied by a run in which no tick ever reached the step at all, which is the
# failure mode this repo has shipped six times, and exactly how the issue's own F10-02 reproduction
# reads on this code: its monolith is never aged, so its "no skip_archive" step passes with nothing
# having run. The file pins its setup with liveness witnesses (the monolith really is frozen, the ticks
# really replaced it with three months, the aged month really took several chunks), but nothing re-checks
# that those witnesses would fail if the aggregate-free reads they guard were put back. Pointing the same
# file at a mutant is what checks that, every CI run, instead of once by hand in a commit message.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py), one per site:
#   regrain_copy_watermark_max_uuid   -- regrain_step's copy resumes from max(<control>) again, which
#                                        does not exist for uuid: pgpm.regrain() dies with 42883 and the
#                                        auto-regrain ticks log skip_regrain
#   archive_chunk_boundary_max_uuid   -- _next_archive_chunk sizes the chunk with max(<control>) again:
#                                        the direct call dies and every archive tick logs skip_archive
#   archive_chunk_tie_min_uuid        -- _next_archive_chunk extends past ties with min(<control>) again,
#                                        reached only when a chunk is budget-limited, which is why the
#                                        file forces the aged month into several chunks
#
