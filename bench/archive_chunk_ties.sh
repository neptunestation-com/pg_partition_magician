#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. The defect it guards against (#513) is a stall with no
# symptom: the chunk picker returned no chunk, _archive_step moved on without a log row, and the
# partition simply stayed. Almost every assertion in the file is therefore about something that must
# have HAPPENED (a ledger row past the burst, a retain_drop, a relation gone), and the one negative in
# it, "nothing was deferred or refused", is satisfied by the defect exactly as well as by the fix. The
# file pins its setup with liveness witnesses (the burst really decodes to one native unit, the budget
# really holds fewer rows than the burst, the first chunk really stopped at the burst's edge), but
# nothing re-checks that the assertions after them would fail if the fix were removed. Pointing the same
# file at a mutant is what checks that, every CI run, instead of once by hand in a commit message.
#
# The mutation it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   archive_chunk_native_ties  -- the extension past the encoding's unit removed, so a next distinct
#                                 column value that decodes to the chunk's own lo makes the picker return
#                                 nothing, which is pre-#513 behaviour exactly: tests/125's ledger stays
#                                 at its first chunk and the 2020 child is never retired
#
# Usage: archive_chunk_ties.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# Runs on the plain core image (it needs pgtap and pg_prove, both of which it has). ARCHIVE_TIES_TEST_FILE
# overrides the test file's path inside the container, for running from a worktree that is mounted
# somewhere other than /repo.
