# Run tests/125_untransmute_residue_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of pgpm_core/install.sql, so
# bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its load-bearing assertions are negatives -- "the restored
# table carries no trigger", "the fine copy is gone", "the capture function is gone" -- and a negative is
# equally satisfied by a run in which there was never a block or a regrain to strip, which is the failure
# mode this repo has shipped six times. The file pins its setup with liveness witnesses of its own (the
# monolith really carries pgpm_write_block and really rejects a write; the capture trigger really sits on
# the monolith and really lands an update in the delta), but nothing re-checks that those witnesses would
# still fail if the stripping they guard were removed. Pointing the same file at a mutant is what checks
# that, every CI run, instead of once by hand in a commit message.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   untransmute_keeps_write_block      -- untransmute no longer lifts pgpm_write_block from the monolith,
#                                         which is pre-#508 behaviour exactly: a retention-blocked table
#                                         comes back unmanaged and permanently read-only
#   untransmute_keeps_regrain_capture  -- untransmute no longer abandons an in-flight regrain, so the
#                                         capture trigger rides the restored table and its own
#                                         `drop function` dies on the dependency, as before #508
#
# Usage: untransmute_residue.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# Runs on the plain core image (it needs pgtap and pg_prove, both of which it has).
# UNTRANSMUTE_RESIDUE_TEST_FILE overrides the test file's path inside the container, for running from a
# worktree that is mounted somewhere other than /repo.
