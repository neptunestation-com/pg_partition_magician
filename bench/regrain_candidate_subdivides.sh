#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its central assertions are negatives -- "no tick
# answered nosubdiv", "the cell the target cannot split was never touched" -- and a negative is equally
# satisfied by a run in which auto-regrain never reached the cell at all, which is the failure mode
# this repo has shipped six times. The file pins its setup with liveness witnesses of its own (the
# guard accepted the target, the first year really was split, the cell that wedged the unfixed code
# really is attached and coarse by the grid's step and one target step wide), but nothing re-checks
# that those witnesses would still be met with the defect back and the fix assertions then FAIL.
# Pointing the same file at a mutant is what checks that, every CI run, instead of once by hand.
#
# The mutation it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   regrain_candidate_ignores_target -- maintain()'s auto-regrain candidate query back to "coarse by
#                                       partition_step and frozen" alone, without the "and the target
#                                       subdivides it" clause (and progress().coarse_frozen to match),
#                                       which is pre-#515 behaviour exactly: a 30-day cell that starts
#                                       in February on a monthly grid is the oldest candidate on every
#                                       tick, regrain_step answers 'nosubdiv', and the coarse year
#                                       behind it is never regrained
#
