# Run tests/124_regrain_reconcile_snapshot_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of pgpm_core/install.sql,
# so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its central assertion is a negative -- "T1's committed
# UPDATE is not reverted by the swap" -- and a negative is equally satisfied by a run in which T1
# committed after the tick had already finished, or before it started, so that no capture ever sat
# below the watermark uncommitted while the apply statements ran. The file pins its own setup with
# liveness witnesses (the tick was observed inside its apply loop when T1 committed; T1's capture was
# in the delta with a pgpm_seq below the batch's highest), but nothing re-checks that those witnesses
# would still let the file fail if the fix they guard were removed. Pointing the same file at a
# mutant is what checks that, every CI run, instead of once by hand in a commit message (#497).
#
# The mutation it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   regrain_reconcile_delete_by_watermark -- the tick's final delete consumes every eligible delta row
#                                            at or below the batch's highest pgpm_seq, under its own
#                                            later snapshot, instead of exactly the rows the apply
#                                            statements addressed: pre-#497 behaviour at the one
#                                            statement where the loss happened. A capture that
#                                            committed mid-tick is deleted unapplied, and tests/124
#                                            sees id 150000 revert to 'orig' through the swap.

# RECONCILE_SNAPSHOT_TEST_FILE overrides the test file's path inside the container, for running from a
# worktree that is mounted somewhere other than /repo.
