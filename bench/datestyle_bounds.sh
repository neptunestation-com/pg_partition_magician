# Run tests/124_datestyle_independent_bounds_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of pgpm_core/install.sql,
# so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. Same reason as bench/grid_timezone.sh, which spells it out at length: the
# file is a plain pgTAP file that the default matrix already runs on every version and channel, so this
# script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES.
# Its decisive assertions are identities ("the stored hi is '2026-10-01 00:00:00+00'", "read from an
# ISO, MDY session it is the first of next month"), but the rows-survive and nothing-dropped assertions
# around them are negatives, and a negative is equally satisfied by a run that never set up the
# disagreement: a session that was not really on SQL, DMY, a tick that never reached its retain step. The
# file pins those with liveness witnesses of its own; pointing the same file at a mutant is what checks,
# every CI run, that the witnesses and the identities together would fail if the DateStyle pin were gone.
#
# The mutation it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   datestyle_session_render -- pgpm._ts_text without its `set datestyle = 'ISO, MDY'` clause, so every
#                               native render follows the SESSION's DateStyle again, which is pre-#500
#                               behaviour exactly: a transmute under SQL, DMY stores '01/10/2026 ...' and
#                               the default-style maintain reads it as 10 January and drops the live
#                               monolith
#
# Usage: datestyle_bounds.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# Runs on the plain core image (it needs pgtap and pg_prove, both of which it has). DATESTYLE_TEST_FILE
# overrides the test file's path inside the container, for running from a worktree that is mounted
# somewhere other than /repo.
