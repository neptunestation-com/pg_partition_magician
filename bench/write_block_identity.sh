#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that its #429 assertions DISCRIMINATE. Part A's are negatives -- "the substitute did
# NOT get a trigger", "pgpm issued no DDL against it" -- and a negative is equally satisfied by a
# write-block pass that installed nothing anywhere, which is the failure mode this repo has shipped
# six times. The file pins that with liveness witnesses of its own (the recorded child_oid, the
# substitute's different oid, the substitute carrying no triggers going in, and an untouched sibling
# that IS blocked by the same pass), but nothing re-checks that those witnesses would fail if the
# guard they guard were removed.
#
# THREE mutations are required to fail against it, one per part, and none is redundant -- each is a
# different plausible way to get this wrong:
#   write_block_unanchored_name         -- the identity check deleted, so CREATE TRIGGER lands on
#                                          whatever answers to the name. Pre-#429 behaviour exactly.
#                                          Breaks PART A.
#   write_block_remove_anchored         -- the symmetrical-looking mistake #429 declined to make:
#                                          anchoring _remove_write_block too, which strands a trigger
#                                          a pre-#429 version already put on a substituted relation
#                                          and leaves it read-only with no pgpm-side recovery.
#                                          Breaks PART B only.
#   write_block_refuses_missing_relation -- the other tempting consistency fix: firing on a name that
#                                          resolves to nothing, the way retire() and _archive_step
#                                          do. That misreports a dropped partition as a substitution
#                                          AND silently retires tests/94's loop-isolation coverage,
#                                          whose poison would stop raising. Breaks PART C only.
