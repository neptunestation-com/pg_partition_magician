#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its central assertions are negatives -- "the mis-typed
# strategy was refused", "config.archive_fn is unchanged", "the mis-typed strategy was never called",
# "no partition was dropped on a ledger row it produced" -- and a negative is equally satisfied by a
# run in which the mis-typed candidate never got past the regprocedure cast, or in which the tick never
# reached the archive step at all. The file pins its own setup with liveness witnesses (the cast alone
# accepts the candidate; a well-typed twin with the same argument list is accepted; the tick called
# the well-typed strategy for the exact chunk and dropped the partition after a real archive), but
# nothing re-checks that those witnesses would still let the file fail if the check they guard were
# removed. Pointing the same file at a mutant is what checks that, every CI run, instead of once by
# hand in a commit message (#517).
#
# The mutation it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   set_archive_fn_no_return_type_check -- set_archive_fn back to its pre-#517 body: the regprocedure
#                                          cast alone, which resolves the argument list and nothing
#                                          else, so a `returns text` strategy is installed, the next
#                                          tick maps its one column onto covered_hi, a strategy echoing
#                                          p_hi passes the contract check, and the partition is dropped
#                                          on a ledger row with rows_archived null. tests/129 fails
#                                          against this on the refusals, on the unchanged switch, on
#                                          the strategy that was called, and on the ledger row.
