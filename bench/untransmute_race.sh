# Guard untransmute's one-way door against a writer racing its check (issue #443). Run by CI
# (`./test.sh perf`).
#
# THE BAR: untransmute must never drop a committed row. It refuses when any row lives outside the
# original monolith ("a metadata-only reverse would lose data"), and before #443 that refusal was
# decided once, under ACCESS SHARE, by a `select exists` that cannot see another session's uncommitted
# insert. The DETACH and DROP that act on its answer took their ACCESS EXCLUSIVE later. So a writer
# whose insert into a forward partition was uncommitted at the check, and committed before that lock
# was granted, had its row dropped with the parent, and pgpm.log recorded `untransmute` as a success.
# The fix takes the lock explicitly, one statement before the DETACH would have, and asks the question
# again under it.
#
# WHAT THIS DRIVES. Three sessions, in the order the race needs, with no timing guesses:
#
#   the WRITER   begins, inserts one row (id 7777) into a forward partition, and then parks in a
#                server-side loop polling a gate table, so the insert stays UNCOMMITTED for exactly as
#                long as this guard wants and not a millisecond longer than it takes to release it.
#   untransmute  runs in a second session once the writer's lock is visible. It passes its unlocked
#                check (the row is invisible to it) and blocks on ACCESS EXCLUSIVE, behind the writer's
#                ROW EXCLUSIVE.
#   this script  polls pg_locks from a third session until it sees untransmute WAITING, records the
#                writer's state at that instant, then opens the gate. The writer commits, untransmute
#                gets its lock, and what it does next is the property under test.
#
# THE LIVENESS WITNESS, and why the verdict is worthless without it. "The row was not lost" is a
# negative, and a negative is equally satisfied by a run where the race never happened: a writer that
# committed before untransmute ever looked (then the FIRST check refuses, exactly as tests/27 shows it
# does, and the fix is not exercised), a writer that failed to connect, an untransmute that hit an
# unrelated error before reaching the lock. So the guard asserts, from the third session and BEFORE
# releasing the writer, that untransmute is already waiting for AccessExclusiveLock on the parent
# (granted = false) while the writer still holds an open xid and a granted RowExclusiveLock on it. The
# wait proves the unlocked check has already run and passed; the open xid proves the row it missed is
# still uncommitted. If either witness fails the guard fails, rather than reporting a clean bill of
# health for a race that was never in place.
#
# THE INSTRUMENT'S COST AGAINST THE WINDOW'S WIDTH. A `docker exec ... psql` sample costs 40-80 ms on
# this machine, which would be useless against a window that lasts 4 ms (bench/restore_fk_lock.sh's
# lesson). It is adequate here because the window is not a duration at all: untransmute stays parked
# on its lock wait until THIS script opens the gate, so the state persists for as long as the poll
# takes to notice it, and nothing about the verdict depends on how long that was. The sampling
# sessions never touch public.ur while untransmute waits: a new ACCESS SHARE request queues behind a
# PENDING ACCESS EXCLUSIVE, so a sample that read the table would deadlock the guard against the very
# wait it is trying to witness. Every witness reads pg_locks and pg_stat_activity only.
#
# THE OTHER DIRECTION. A fix that made untransmute refuse unconditionally would pass every assertion
# above, so a second table with no concurrent writer must still untransmute cleanly.
#
# Measured on PG 17.11 against this exact fixture, 2026-09-24:
#
#   pre-#443 install.sql, and the mutation untransmute_no_recheck_under_lock (identical results)
#                all three witnesses PASS, then untransmute returns normally with exit 0, no row
#                answers to id 7777 through public.ur, public.ur is relkind r, pgpm.config has no
#                row for it and pgpm.log carries an `untransmute` success row: 7 checks FAIL,
#                while the uncontended ur_clean direction still passes, so the failure is the
#                defect's and not the fixture's                                    FAIL, exit 1
#   fixed        all three witnesses PASS, untransmute exits non-zero with the one-way-door message,
#                row 7777 reads back as 'late' from ur_p2026_10 through public.ur, and ur_clean
#                reverses cleanly                                                  PASS, 20 of 20
