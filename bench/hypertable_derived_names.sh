# Run tests/timescale/db/23_from_hypertable_derived_names_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_hypertable/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the timescale track already runs it,
# so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the standing proof that its #552
# assertions DISCRIMINATE. The subject is a refusal of from_hypertable_copy and from_hypertable_cutover,
# both committing procedures, so each is wrapped by throws_like: a copy that wrongly does NOT refuse dies
# at its first COMMIT inside the wrapper with 2D000 and rolls back into the very state a refusal leaves
# (nothing created, the source still writable). The refusal's own message is the only thing that tells
# the two apart, so pointing the file at a mutant is the only way to know the message assertions are
# load-bearing rather than incidental.
#
# The mutation it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   hypertable_derived_names_unchecked -- _from_hypertable_check_names refuses nothing, the pre-#552
#                                         shape: the working names are cut to 63 bytes again, and at 55
#                                         bytes the destination takes the delta's name
#
# Usage: hypertable_derived_names.sh <container> <db> [pgpm_hypertable/install.sql]
# Runs on the TIMESCALE track's container (supabase/postgres + TimescaleDB), which is why its mutation
# sits in MUTATION_TRACK=timescale: `./test.sh discriminate` must stay runnable on a laptop without that
# image. That image does not trust the local socket, so every psql call goes over TCP (see run_timescale).
