# Run tests/timescale/db/17_from_hypertable_cutover_identity_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_hypertable/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the timescale track already runs
# it, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the standing proof that its #422
# assertions DISCRIMINATE -- and here that proof carries more weight than usual, because of a
# constraint the test file itself documents at length: run_timescale fails the track on any `ERROR:`
# line, so the cutover has to be wrapped by throws_like, and a procedure reaching its own COMMIT
# inside a function raises `invalid transaction termination`. A cutover that WRONGLY succeeds
# therefore cannot be observed committing -- it dies at its commit and rolls back into the same end
# state as a correct refusal. The refusal's own message is the only thing that separates them, so
# "the message is asserted exactly" is not stylistic here; it is the whole guard, and pointing the
# file at a mutant is the only way to know the message assertion is load-bearing rather than
# incidental.
#
# TWO mutations are required to fail against it, one per half of the swap, and each must break ONLY
# its own half -- which is how a failure says which half went missing (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   hypertable_cutover_unverified_source -- the by-name lock restored, no re-resolve. Breaks PART A.
#   hypertable_cutover_unverified_dest   -- the destination lock-and-verify deleted. Breaks PART B.
#
# Usage: hypertable_cutover_identity.sh <container> <db> [pgpm_hypertable/install.sql]
# Runs on the TIMESCALE track's container (supabase/postgres + TimescaleDB), which is why these
# mutations sit in their own MUTATION_TRACK rather than the default one: `./test.sh discriminate`
# must stay runnable on a laptop without that image, exactly as for locktrace.
#
# psql, not pg_prove: the supabase/postgres image has no pg_prove, which is why run_timescale parses
# TAP out of psql -tAq itself. This does the same, including the ERROR: check -- a mutant that dies
# with a raw error instead of a failed assertion must not read as a pass.
