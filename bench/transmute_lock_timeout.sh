# Guard transmute against waiting forever for a lock (issue #309). Run by CI (`./test.sh perf`).
#
# THE DEFECT. transmute takes ACCESS EXCLUSIVE twice on the operator's live table: phase 1's
# ADD CONSTRAINT, and phase 3's RENAME. With no lock_timeout it waits indefinitely for whatever is
# already holding a conflicting lock -- and a PENDING AccessExclusive request blocks every lock request
# queued behind it, including plain SELECTs that conflict with nothing running. So one slow query turns
# transmute's wait into a full outage of the table, with nothing to break it.
#
# WHY A SHELL HARNESS. Asserting this needs a SECOND SESSION holding a lock while a first attempts the
# conversion, and pgTAP gives one session per file. Same reason bench/transmute_lock.sh is here.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS, and why each one is load-bearing:
#
#   1. transmute FAILS, with SQLSTATE 55P03 (lock_not_available) specifically. Not "fails somehow": a
#      typo in the CALL, a missing table, or a bad parameter would all fail too, and would pass a test
#      that only asked for failure.
#   2. It fails CLEANLY: the table is still an ordinary relation with no pgpm state behind it. Phase 1
#      is where the first AEL is taken, so a correct timeout leaves nothing committed.
#   3. LIVENESS WITNESS: with the blocker released, the SAME call succeeds. Without this the guard
#      passes vacuously against a build where transmute is broken for some unrelated reason -- the
#      exact absence-of-defect vs absence-of-setup confusion CLAUDE.md warns about.
#
# It asserts SQLSTATE and end state, not wall-clock, so there is nothing to flake on a shared runner.
# The one time bound is a loose hang ceiling (HANG_CEILING, many times the lock_timeout) that exists
# only so an unfixed build reports FAIL instead of hanging CI forever.
#
# Usage: transmute_lock_timeout.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# The install path defaults to the real one; bench/discriminate.sh passes a MUTANT copy instead, to
# prove this guard actually fails when the defect is present.
