# Guard obtain's back-off against outlasting the forward grid, and against ignoring grid it cannot see.
# Run by CI (`./test.sh perf`, and `./test.sh discriminate` proves it catches both defects).
#
# THE DEFECT. maintain_obtain() runs obtain under a 200 ms lock_timeout, and a lost race sets
# config.obtain_retry_after 30 s out so sustained write contention does not queue an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on
# the parent every tick. The back-off predates #288, when a DEFAULT partition caught any write past the
# grid. Since #288 such a write is refused, and a fixed back-off can outlast the lookahead: a local load
# test (~42k ids/s against obtain 3 x step 200000, ~14 s of grid) lost one race, backed off 30 s, and every
# client aborted with `no partition of relation ... found for row`. The fix honors the back-off only while
# at least ceil(obtain / 2) complete grid steps of attached coverage remain beyond the frontier's own cell.
#
# THE OVER-CORRECTION. Headroom is COVERAGE, not a count of partitions that start past the frontier.
# transmute's p_bound_headroom gives the monolith a permanent hi several steps beyond the frontier; that room
# is real, but the monolith's lo is far behind the frontier, so a count of "partitions starting ahead" sees
# none of it and bypasses the back-off every tick, retrying the very ACCESS EXCLUSIVE the back-off exists to
# spare a contended table (reported in review on #386 and reproduced).
#
# WHY A SHELL HARNESS, GIVEN tests/100 ALREADY PROVES THE DECISION. tests/100 sets obtain_retry_after by hand.
# Only a second session holding a real lock can show the path that actually produced the outage: a genuine
# lock-timeout deferral, logged and backed off, followed by a tick whose decision is then under test.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS, and why each is load-bearing (step 1000, obtain 4):
#   public.ob_race (monolith [0,1000), grid top 5000):
#   1. + 2. LIVENESS WITNESS: the race really happened -- a skip_obtain row carrying the lock-timeout error,
#      and a back-off set in the future. Without these, every assertion below could pass against a tick
#      that never contended for anything.
#   3. The back-off still holds while headroom is ample (frontier in [2000,3000), 2 steps covered beyond it):
#      the next tick creates nothing even though obtain has partitions to create. A "fix" that deletes the
#      back-off fails here.
#   4. The back-off is still in the future immediately before the low-headroom tick, so assertion 5 cannot
#      pass merely because 30 s elapsed.
#   5. + 6. With headroom low (frontier in [4000,5000), 0 steps beyond) the tick extends the grid anyway, by
#      identity: the attached [lo,hi) cells are exactly [0,1000) .. [8000,9000), and a write into [5000,6000),
#      the first cell the bypass must build, is accepted, as is one at 8999, the last. A count of partitions
#      is not identity (#913): an obtain that skips [5000,6000) and builds [9000,10000) instead has the same
#      count, takes the 8999 write, and refuses every write in the hole, which is the very outage this guard
#      exists for. Every grid check below names its cells for the same reason.
#   public.ob_hr (p_bound_headroom => 4: the monolith [0,5000) is the only partition):
#   7. + 8. LIVENESS WITNESS again, for this table's own race.
#   9. Frontier in [1000,2000) leaves 3 steps covered INSIDE the monolith: the back-off holds and nothing is
#      created, although obtain has [5000,6000) to create. Counting only partitions that start past the
#      frontier fails here.
#   public.ob_q (obtain 3, where ceil(3/2)=2 but integer 3/2=1):
#   10. + 11. LIVENESS WITNESS again, for this table's own race.
#   12. With exactly 1 complete step of headroom the tick must still extend the grid: 1 < ceil(3/2). Integer
#       division makes the threshold 1, so the back-off would be honored and nothing created. obtain 4 (above)
#       cannot see that difference, since ceil(4/2) and 4/2 are both 2. Asserted as the cells [0,1000) ..
#       [5000,6000), plus a write into [4000,5000), the first cell the bypass must build.

# prove this guard actually fails when the defect is present.
