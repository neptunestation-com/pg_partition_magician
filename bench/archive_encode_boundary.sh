# Run tests/archive/db/10_encode_boundary_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_archive/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. The boundary test is a plain pgTAP file and the archive track
# already runs it every time, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that it DISCRIMINATES. #408's assertions are negatives ("the payload landed as a
# quoted identifier, not as SQL", "the victim table is still there"), and a negative is also
# satisfied by a test that never reached the code it is about -- the failure mode this repo has
# shipped six times. That proof was originally obtained by hand, once, against two hand-planted
# regressions; run_archive's pg_prove has no way to re-obtain it, and evidence that lives in a
# commit message decays immediately. Pointing the same file at a mutant turns it into a check.
#
# The two mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   archive_from_item_raw_splice  -- %I weakened to %s in archive._pq_from_item, i.e. the FROM item
#                                    pasted in unquoted, which is exactly what p_from_sql used to be
#   archive_order_by_raw_splice   -- quote_ident dropped from the ORDER BY build, i.e. p_order_by's
#                                    elements pasted in unquoted, which is what p_order_by used to be
#
# Usage: archive_encode_boundary.sh <container> <db> [archive install.sql]
# Needs the archive image (pgsql-http + pgtap + pg_prove), not the plain core one.
