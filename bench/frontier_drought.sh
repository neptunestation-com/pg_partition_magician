# Guard the uuidv7 AND text_time forward frontier against a data drought (issue #325). Run by CI
# (`./test.sh perf`, and `./test.sh discriminate` proves it catches its defect).
#
# THE DEFECT. Every control kind's forward frontier is either the clock (`time`) or bounded by it
# (`id` has no clock, so it cannot fall behind where the next write goes). `uuidv7` and `text_time` are
# time grids fed by DATA: pre-#325, their frontier was plain `max(control)`, decoded. A table whose
# writes go quiet -- a restored dump, a stale clone, a table that just stops getting writes for
# `obtain x step` -- has that frontier stuck wherever the data ended while now() keeps moving. obtain
# then measures itself against its own past output, finds nothing to do, and the grid stalls exactly
# where the drought began. Every write past it is refused with a bare `no partition of relation ...
# found for row`, permanently, and nothing in the log distinguishes this tick from a healthy one.
#
# BOTH KINDS ARE EXERCISED SEPARATELY, not inferred from one covering the other, even though they share
# the same code path in _frontier_native and _transmute's inline duplicate. That sharing was exactly
# what made a real gap easy to miss while building text_time: generalizing _frontier_native's kind list
# without also generalizing _transmute's inline duplicate produced a table with a correctly-healing
# ONGOING frontier but a monolith whose INITIAL bound was still data-only, leaving a multi-month gap
# with no partition at all -- covered by neither kind's own single-site tests. Only running the full
# transmute-then-maintain sequence against both kinds independently would catch that.
#
# WHY A SHELL HARNESS, GIVEN tests/85 and tests/88 ALREADY PROVE THE LOGIC. They do, inside one pgTAP
# transaction each. What that cannot show is the property the issue itself measured: that the fix holds
# up across SEPARATE maintenance ticks over real (if small) elapsed wall-clock time, not just one
# evaluation of now(). It also is not wired into bench/discriminate.sh's mutation-proof machinery --
# CLAUDE.md's rule that a guard this easy to write vacuously is worthless without a kept, standing proof
# it discriminates applies here regardless of which harness the guard lives in, and the mutation
# apparatus only drives guards under bench/.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS, per kind, and why each one is load-bearing:
#
#   1. LIVENESS WITNESS: the backfilled data really is stale enough to wedge under the pre-#325 rule
#      (> obtain x step behind now()). Every assertion below reads as "obtain still reaches now()",
#      which would also pass vacuously against a fixture that was never actually stale.
#   2. + 3. per tick, across THREE SEPARATE `pgpm.maintain()` calls (three separate sessions, three
#      separate now()s, matching the issue's own "across five ticks" table): a partition covers now()
#      BY IDENTITY (its own [lo, hi), not "some partition exists somewhere"), and a row stamped at now()
#      is accepted rather than refused. Checked every tick, not once, because the pre-#325 defect's
#      defining symptom was that nothing changes tick over tick -- a guard that only checked tick 1
#      could not tell "fixed" apart from "coincidentally not wedged yet".
#   4. + 5. per tick, what ONLY _frontier_native produces (#846): the frontier itself is at or past now(),
#      and a FORWARD partition (one starting at or past the monolith's hi, so not the monolith) covers
#      now() + 1 month, inside the 2-month lookahead. Each tick runs maintain_obtain() after maintain(),
#      as the two pg_cron jobs do since #347, because obtain is what plans that grid from the frontier.
#      2 and 3 cannot tell the two #325 sites apart: _transmute's inline greatest() alone gives the
#      monolith an upper bound past now(), so with only _frontier_native reverted both still hold on the
#      day of the transmute, while obtain plans nothing past the monolith and the table runs out of
#      partitions once the drought outlasts its hi.
#      frontier_native_data_only (that site alone) is the mutation that proves these two discriminate;
#      frontier_data_only (both sites) is the one 2 and 3 already caught.
#
# Usage: frontier_drought.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# The install path defaults to the real one; bench/discriminate.sh passes a MUTANT copy instead, to
# prove this guard actually fails when the defect is present.
