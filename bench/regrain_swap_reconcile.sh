# Run tests/107_regrain_swap_reconcile_complete_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_core/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant. Run by CI (`./test.sh perf`).
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its claim is a negative -- "no captured change is lost
# when a writer commits more than the old bound while the swap waits on the DETACH" -- and a negative
# is equally satisfied by a run in which the writer never landed in the window at all, which is the
# failure mode this repo has shipped six times. The file pins the setup with liveness witnesses of its
# own (the writer's recorded sighting of the swap's ungranted ACCESS EXCLUSIVE, a reconcile pass count
# above the old bound, a consumed-key total equal to what was captured), but nothing re-checks that
# those witnesses would fail if the guard they guard were removed. Pointing the same file at a mutant is
# what checks that, every CI run, instead of once by hand in a commit message.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   regrain_swap_reconcile_bounded          -- the pre-#447 swap exactly: the residual reconcile runs for
#                                              at most 100 passes and the source is dropped
#                                              unconditionally. The file fails on its identity
#                                              assertions AFTER a swap that reported success: 20,001
#                                              late rows missing, one deleted row resurrected.
#   regrain_swap_reconcile_bounded_checked  -- the bound alone, with the pre-drop check left in place.
#                                              Not a historical shape; it exists to prove the check is
#                                              live. The file fails on the swap tick itself, which
#                                              raises rather than drop the source. The two failures
#                                              being different is what tells the two layers apart.
#
# Usage: regrain_swap_reconcile.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# Runs on the plain core image (it needs pgtap, dblink and pg_prove, all of which it has). TEST_FILE
# can be overridden in the environment so a worktree can point it at its own copy of the file; the
# default is the path CI's bind mount gives it.
