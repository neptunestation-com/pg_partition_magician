# Run tests/archive/db/15_parquet_single_snapshot_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_archive/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant, and then read the racy
# files that test leaves behind with an independent Parquet reader.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. Test 15 is a plain pgTAP file and the archive track already runs it, so
# on correct code the first half of this script adds nothing. What it adds is the standing proof that
# the file DISCRIMINATES: its assertions are identities ("the racy file is byte-identical to a
# single-snapshot encode") paired with liveness witnesses, and a file that never raced anything would
# also find its racy encode equal to the quiescent one. That proof was first obtained by hand, once,
# against the pre-#462 code (8000 of 8000 rows misaligned); pointing the same file at a mutant every
# CI run is what keeps it from decaying into a commit message.
#
# The second half is what the file cannot do from inside the database: pyarrow, a reader that shares
# no code with the writer, reads each racy file back and asserts id = tag on EVERY row, which is the
# user-visible property #462 is about (a well-formed file whose tags belong to the neighbouring rows).
# The venv is the one run_archive builds for scripts/verify_parquet*.py; under `./test.sh
# discriminate` it may not exist yet, so it is created here the same way. No pyarrow is a FAIL, not a
# skip: a reader that did not run verified nothing.
#
# The mutation it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   parquet_per_column_statements -- archive._pq_snapshot's temp TABLE becomes a temp VIEW over the
#                                    live relation and its row count a separate count(*), so every
#                                    per-column read goes back to the relation under a snapshot of
#                                    its own: the pre-#462 read exactly
#
# Usage: archive_parquet_snapshot.sh <container> <db> [archive install.sql]
# Needs the archive image (pgsql-http + pgtap + pg_prove + dblink) AND MinIO on the same compose
# network: the test's strategy-path half PUTs through archive._encode_upload_parquet and fetches the
# object back. run_archive creates the bucket before any test runs; run_discriminate does not, so the
# bucket is created here too, idempotently and the same way (a SigV4 PUT from the curl image; 200 is
# created, 409 is already there), after waiting for MinIO to report ready.
