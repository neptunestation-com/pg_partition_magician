# Guard transmute against re-acquiring a data-coupled lock (issue #275). Run by CI (`./test.sh perf`).
#
# THE BAR (issue #263's acceptance rule): a blocking lock may last milliseconds, but it must never last a
# duration coupled to data size. transmute's validation scan is O(rows); the whole point of splitting the
# conversion into three transactions is that the scan runs under SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE, which blocks
# nobody, instead of under the ACCESS EXCLUSIVE the preceding ADD takes.
#
# Before the split, both locks were held at once and a plain SELECT died on lock_timeout. That regression
# would be invisible to the pgTAP suite: asserting it needs a SECOND SESSION observing a first one
# mid-scan, and pgTAP gives one session per file. Hence a shell harness, like bench/regrain_perf.sh.
#
# It asserts LOCK MODES and whether a concurrent reader survives, not wall-clock, so there is nothing to
# flake on a shared runner.
#
# Usage: transmute_lock.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# The install path defaults to the real one; bench/discriminate.sh passes a MUTANT copy instead, to
# prove this guard actually fails when the defect is present.

# Convert in the background and observe from a second session. The observation runs SERVER-SIDE, in one
# psql call: polling with repeated `docker exec` costs ~100 ms per sample, which is longer than the scan
# itself, so the probe could never land inside the window and every assertion passed vacuously. Seen
# happening on both the fixed and the broken code while writing this, which is why the harness now demands
# positive evidence that it caught the scan and treats missing it as a FAIL rather than a pass.
