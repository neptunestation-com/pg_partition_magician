# Guard a maintenance tick against holding a data-coupled lock (issue #279). Run by CI (`./test.sh perf`).
#
# THE BAR (issue #263's acceptance rule): a blocking lock may last milliseconds, but it must never last a
# duration coupled to data size.
#
# Two independent pairings, both driven from one maintain_all() sweep over two managed tables:
#
#   1. obtain (public.ml). pgpm.obtain takes ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on the PARENT (CREATE TABLE ... PARTITION
#      OF). Issue #347 split obtain out of maintain()/maintain_all() into its own procedure,
#      maintain_obtain(), and its own cron job -- an operator (or, as here, a probe modelling the worst
#      case) can still run it immediately before a maintain_all() tick in the same session, which is
#      exactly what this guard drives, so the property under test is unchanged: obtain's ACCESS EXCLUSIVE
#      must not survive into whatever long step follows it. The long step used to be the drain; #288
#      removed it and the DEFAULT with it, so it is now a REGRAIN copy microbatch.
#
#   2. retain (public.mg_ret), a second, throwaway table swept in the SAME maintain_all() call ahead of
#      ml (its name sorts first; pgpm.config is swept `order by parent_table`). retain's DROP also takes
#      ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on ITS parent (maintain()'s own comment: "retain DROPs partitions, which takes
#      ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on the parent"), immediately before maintain_all()'s loop moves on to ml's turn.
#      For this to leak into ml's regrain copy, EVERY commit standing between the two has to be missing:
#      maintain()'s OWN internal boundary right after retain, the (easy to miss) one before FK-validate
#      (issue #265 -- it commits unconditionally every tick, with or without an incoming FK, so it is
#      just as much a release point as the retain-specific one), and maintain_all()'s outer per-parent
#      commit. Confirmed the hard way: a mutant missing all but the #265 boundary still passed this
#      guard, because that ONE boundary alone was enough to release mg_ret's lock before ml's turn.
#      A single table cannot drive this pairing at all: retain()/write-block always pick the OLDEST
#      eligible partition first (`order by lo`), which is always the monolith regrain needs intact, so
#      retain and regrain can never coexist as short-lock-then-long-step on one table. write-block itself
#      was ruled out entirely: CREATE TRIGGER takes ShareRowExclusiveLock, which does not conflict with a
#      plain SELECT, so no reader-probe technique can observe its lock surviving anything -- confirmed
#      empirically, not merely assumed from the old (mistaken) comment this file used to carry.
#
# The assertion is the consequence an operator would actually see, not the lock mode: a plain SELECT
# against each parent, with a lock_timeout far shorter than the regrain batch, must never time out during
# a tick. obtain's and retain's own windows are each ~1 ms (pure metadata), far under the reader's 1 s
# timeout, so neither verdict rides on a close call.
#
# Usage: maintain_lock.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# The install path defaults to the real one; bench/discriminate.sh passes a MUTANT copy instead, to
# prove this guard actually fails when the defect is present.

# maintain_obtain() and maintain_all() are two separate top-level statements (issue #347: they are two
# separate cron jobs in production), so obtain's own commit already ends its transaction before
# maintain_all() even starts -- there is no longer a shared transaction for its lock to leak across.
# Running it immediately first, in the same session, keeps the "did real work" liveness witness below
# meaningful without changing what the probe watches for. maintain_all() itself now sweeps BOTH tables:
# mg_ret's retain-drop first, then ml's write-block/archive/retain(no-op)/regrain.
#
# Two things this probe has to get right, both learned by getting them wrong:
#
# 1. COMMIT after every read. AccessShareLock is held to transaction end and a DO block is ONE
#    transaction, so a probe that just loops on SELECT pins AccessShareLock for its whole run. retain
#    then cannot get ACCESS EXCLUSIVE within its 200 ms lock_timeout and DEFERS -- the tick logs
#    skip_retain, takes no strong lock at all, and the guard passes having tested nothing.
#
# 2. Do not read until the tick has had its chance. Each step fails fast by design, so a probe holding
#    any lock at the start of the tick suppresses the very step whose lock is under test. Wait for the
#    tick, give it a window, and only then start reading -- by which point a pre-fix run is still holding
#    a lock from an earlier step into the regrain copy, and a post-fix run has committed and released it.
#
# pg_stat_activity is read once per transaction and then frozen (the documented snapshot). The COMMIT
# after every turn of the wait loop below therefore does double duty: it releases the probe's own lock
# (the point made above) AND ends the transaction, so the next turn reads a fresh view and the loop is a
# poll that can wait. Measured on PG 15 (#713): the same loop in one transaction never saw the tick start
# in 400 turns; with a COMMIT per turn it saw it on the second. Do not fold the loop into one transaction.
