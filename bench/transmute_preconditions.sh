#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it on
# every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the standing
# proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its claims are negatives -- "no bound on the live parent", "no claim
# left", "not refused as another session's" -- and a negative is equally satisfied by a run that never
# set up the condition at all, which is the failure mode this repo has shipped six times. The file pins
# its setup with witnesses of its own (the table really is converted, the name really is the one the
# conversion needs, the claim's owner really is the op backend and really reads as alive), but nothing
# re-checks that those witnesses would fail if the refusals they guard were removed. Pointing the same
# file at a mutant is what checks that, every CI run, instead of once by hand in a commit message.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py), one per finding of #509:
#   transmute_no_shape_precondition     -- no relkind / pgpm.config / pg_inherits check: a re-run on a
#                                          converted table puts the bound on the live partitioned parent
#   transmute_names_unchecked           -- the monolith's own name unchecked (the cutover's RENAME fails with
#                                          42P07, bound and claim left) and the orphan guard tables-only (a
#                                          sequence holding a child name yields a conversion with no forward
#                                          partition at all)
#   transmute_claim_refuses_own_session -- the claim's owner session refused its own retry and abort
#
# Usage: transmute_preconditions.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# Runs on the plain core image (it needs pgtap, dblink and pg_prove, all of which it has).
# TRANSMUTE_PRECOND_TEST_FILE overrides the test file's path inside the container, for running from a
# worktree that is mounted somewhere other than /repo.
