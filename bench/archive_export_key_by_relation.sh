# Run tests/archive/db/43_archive_export_key_by_relation_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_archive/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. Test 43 is a plain pgTAP file and the archive track already runs it, so on
# correct code this script adds nothing. What it adds is the standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES.
# Its contract (issue #976) is that an export's whole-key claim (archive.object_key_claim) names the relation
# it exported, so the same parent's export of ANOTHER relation (a new one that took a dropped one's name,
# after the documented export-then-drop workflow) is refused at the plain key and at the oid shape alike,
# while a re-run by the same relation still writes. A run in which the second export never ran, or in which
# every export is refused, satisfies "the first object is intact" too, so the file pins each write with
# witnesses (every key absent before its PUT, the re-run's extra row 4 read back, the namesake's distinct
# oid) and with identities (each object's rows as id:payload, each claim's relation oid).
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py), one per site of the fix:
#   archive_export_claim_relation_unchecked  -- archive._owned_key checks the claim by parent and kind
#                                               only, the defect the issue reported (parts A to C)
#   archive_chunk_claim_relation_unrecorded  -- install records no relation for a claim made before the
#                                               column existed (part C)
#
# Usage: archive_export_key_by_relation.sh <container> <db> [archive install.sql]
# Needs the archive image (pgsql-http + pgtap + pg_prove) AND MinIO on the same network: the file PUTs
# NDJSON objects through archive.to_s3. run_archive creates the bucket before any
# test runs; run_discriminate does not, so it is created here too, idempotently and the same way (a SigV4
# PUT from the curl image; 200 is created, 409 is already there), after waiting for MinIO to report ready.
