# Guard the in-place upgrade FROM A REAL RELEASED ARTIFACT: install the oldest release that has the
# transmute lifecycle, transmute a table under it with a preserve-managed incoming FK, re-run the current
# install.sql over it, and require the routine catalog to be identical to a fresh install's, with
# pgpm.schedule() resolving and one maintain tick restoring the FK.
# Run by CI (`./test.sh perf`, and `./test.sh discriminate` proves it catches its defect).
#
# THE DEFECT (issue #441). `create or replace function` with a CHANGED ARGUMENT LIST replaces nothing: it
# creates a second overload beside the first. install.sql carries a `drop function if exists <old
# signature>` line for every historical signature for exactly this reason, and four signature changes
# did not get theirs. On an install at 0.2.0, 0.3.0 or 0.4.0 the upgrade to 0.5.0 or 0.6.0 completed
# without error and pgpm.version() reported the new version, but pg_proc kept pgpm.schedule(text) beside
# pgpm.schedule(text, text) and pgpm.restore_incoming_fks(regclass) beside
# pgpm.restore_incoming_fks(regclass, bigint[]). The new parameter has a default, so the old call shape
# matches BOTH: `select pgpm.schedule()` fails with "is not unique", and so does the
# restore_incoming_fks(p_parent) call maintain() makes every tick. That one is inside a handler, so it
# lands in pgpm.log as one routine-looking `skip_restore_fk` row per tick, and a preserve-managed FK is
# never restored: RI stays off, silently, on precisely the installs that have been running longest.
#
# WHY bench/upgrade_in_place.sh CANNOT SEE IT. That guard degrades a FRESH install by dropping columns
# and upgrades it back, which is the right shape for a missing column backfill and the wrong one for a
# stale signature: a fresh install never has an old function signature to leave behind. Only a real
# older artifact does. The tag's install.sql IS the released artifact for the psql channel (the release
# bundle is the same file between a header and a COMMIT), so `git show <tag>:pgpm_core/install.sql` is
# the origin, and it is fed to psql on stdin so it needs no container path.
#
# WHY v0.2.0 AND NOT v0.1.0. 0.1.0 is the pre-transmute "adopt" release (sql/pg_partition_magician.sql):
# no transmute, no schedule, no restore_incoming_fks, no p_incoming_fks => 'preserve'. It cannot witness
# the two overloads that matter here, and an upgrade from it also leaves its seven adopt-era routines
# behind (adopt, adopt_by_id, adopt_by_uuidv7, _adopt, premake, retention, check_default), removed NAMES
# rather than overloads, so inert, and out of scope for this guard. v0.2.0 is the oldest tag with the
# whole lifecycle under test, and it carries all four stale signatures: the two above and the
# two-argument _encode/_decode that 0.3.0 widened with the text_time parameters.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS, and why each one is load-bearing:
#
#   0. PRECONDITION, loud: the origin artifact was obtained. CI checks out with depth 1 and no tags, so
#      the tag is fetched when missing, and a fetch or `git show` that fails is a FAIL, never a skip. A
#      guard that skipped here would be green having upgraded nothing.
#   1. LIVENESS WITNESS, the one this guard is worthless without: right after installing the origin and
#      BEFORE the upgrade, the four stale signatures are present in pg_proc, by exact identity, and none
#      of them is in the fresh oracle. Every later assertion is of the form "the upgrade removed X", and
#      all of them pass trivially against an origin that never had X (a wrong tag, a wrong path, an
#      artifact that installed something else). The origin's own pgpm.version() is checked for the
#      same reason.
#   2. LIVENESS WITNESS for the FK half: after the origin's transmute the incoming FK really is
#      suspended (pgpm.dropped_fk holds the row with restored_at null and the referencing table has no
#      FK constraint), so the post-upgrade tick has real restore work to do, not a no-op to succeed at.
#   3. The routine catalog after the upgrade is IDENTICAL to a fresh install: name, identity arguments,
#      kind (function or procedure) and result type, for every routine in schema pgpm. Differences are
#      printed BY NAME. This is the assertion the mutation breaks.
#   4. `select pgpm.schedule()` RESOLVES. This is a non-cron database, so the expected outcome is the
#      one specific "pg_cron is not installed" error, matched throws_like style; any other error, "is
#      not unique" in particular, FAILS. Never a blanket handler: that error is what proves the overload
#      resolved and execution reached the body.
#   5. One `call pgpm.maintain()` on the table transmuted under the origin completes, logs NO
#      `skip_restore_fk` row (exact action value), and DOES log `restore_incoming_fk` naming the
#      fixture's constraint, with the FK live again on the referencing table. The positive half is what
#      keeps the negative half honest: "nothing was skipped" is also true of a tick that did nothing.
#   6. Data survived BY IDENTITY (asymmetric fixture: 3 in, 1 out, 2 surviving) and the upgrade was
#      RECORDED in pgpm.installed, the same two checks upgrade_in_place.sh makes, for the same reasons.
#
# Usage: upgrade_from_release.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# The install path is a CONTAINER path and defaults to the real one; bench/discriminate.sh passes a
# MUTANT copy instead, to prove this guard actually fails when the defect is present.
