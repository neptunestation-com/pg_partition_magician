#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it on
# every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the standing
# proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its subject is a refusal, and a refusal is a negative: "transmute did
# not convert this table", "set_regrain did not record this step". A negative is equally satisfied by a
# harness that never presented the condition, which is the failure mode this repo has shipped six times.
# The file pins its setup with liveness witnesses of its own (the relation names really are 60, 55, 52, 44
# characters; the names each refusal denies really are 64, 69 and 80 bytes; the same shape one byte
# shorter really converts and builds its forward grid), but nothing re-checks that those witnesses would
# fail if the refusals they guard were removed. Pointing the same file at a mutant is what checks that,
# every CI run, instead of once by hand in a commit message.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   part_name_silent_truncation               -- _part_name casts through name again with no length check,
#                                                the pre-#510 shape exactly: a 64-byte name is cut to 63
#                                                and the file's transmute-refusal, boundary and
#                                                forward-grid assertions all see a conversion instead
#   transmute_staging_name_silent_truncation  -- the staging name <rel>_pgpm_new is cast to name unchecked,
#                                                so the 55- and 60-character tables convert (or reach the
#                                                monolith check with the wrong message) instead of refusing
#   set_regrain_no_name_check                 -- set_regrain records a target step whose fine names cannot
#                                                fit, leaving every later tick to raise from regrain_step

# overrides the test file's path inside the container, for running from a worktree that is mounted
# somewhere other than /repo.
