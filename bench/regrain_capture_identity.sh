#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it on
# every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the standing
# proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its load-bearing assertions are negatives -- "the committed change is
# honoured after the swap", "the write into the source does not raise", "the app role can still write" --
# and a negative is equally satisfied by a run that never set up the condition it denies, which is the
# failure mode this repo has shipped six times. The file pins its setup with witnesses of its own (the
# derived name really changed, the delta really was minted with the old key, the role really lacked the
# privilege), but nothing re-checks that those witnesses would fail if the identity anchoring they guard
# were removed. Pointing the same file at a mutant is what checks that, every CI run.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   regrain_capture_by_name  -- _regrain_capture_names ignores the oids pgpm.config recorded at prepare
#                               and derives the delta and function from the parent's CURRENT relname again,
#                               which is pre-#496 exactly: rename the parent mid-regrain and reconcile, the
#                               swap gate and the swap all look for a delta that does not exist, count 0
#                               pending, and swap the captured changes away with the source.
#   regrain_delta_reused     -- _regrain_capture_install keeps an existing delta (truncating it) instead of
#                               re-minting it from the current key, so a key column renamed between two
#                               regrains leaves the trigger inserting a column the delta does not have.
#   regrain_delta_ungranted  -- the delta is neither owned like the parent nor granted to its writers, so
#                               every non-owner role with DML on the parent gets 42501 on writes into the
#                               regraining child.

# Usage: regrain_capture_identity.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# Runs on the plain core image (it needs pgtap and pg_prove, both of which it has). REGRAIN_CAPTURE_TEST_FILE
# overrides the test file's path inside the container, for running from a worktree that is mounted
# somewhere other than /repo.
