# Guard a maintenance tick's lock boundaries by OBSERVING them, not inferring them (issue #383).
# Run by CI (`./test.sh locktrace`). Linux-only; see docker-compose.yml's locktrace service.
#
# WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM bench/maintain_lock.sh. That guard proves the same property
# indirectly: a concurrent reader under a short lock_timeout either times out or does not. Cheap,
# portable, runs on a laptop -- and inference. It cannot see a lock it did not happen to collide
# with, and it cannot say WHICH boundary released the lock. That blind spot is not hypothetical:
# redesigning maintain_lock.sh for #347 left it passing while its own mutation regex never matched a
# real, unconditional commit boundary (#265, before FK-validate).
#
# THE INSTRUMENT is bench/lock_probe.py: a purpose-built eBPF probe on two functions, filtering in
# the kernel. It replaced pg-lock-tracer, which this guard used first and which proved unsound as a
# CI foundation for reasons worth not re-learning (#389): it emitted every lock event for the whole
# server through a PER-CPU perf buffer, which delivers out of order across CPUs (4 inversions in
# 101,185 events moved a statement marker 53,000 positions and silently shrank the window under test
# to nothing), and it opened that buffer with no lost_cb, so overflow discarded events in SILENCE
# (4,150 lost in one run, the guard reporting a lock as never released while the commits in the same
# interval proved otherwise). Filtering in the kernel turns ~120,000 events per tick into dozens,
# and BPF_RINGBUF gives one ordered stream plus a drop count the probe reports itself.
#
# THE FIXTURE is maintain_lock.sh's -- two managed tables swept by one maintain_all(), mg_ret first
# (its name sorts before ml, and pgpm.config is swept `order by parent_table`). mg_ret's retain DROPs
# take ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on its parent; ml's regrain copy is the long step that follows. For mg_ret's
# lock to survive into ml's turn, EVERY commit standing between them has to be missing: maintain()'s
# own internal boundaries, the easily-missed #265 one before FK-validate (unconditional every tick,
# with or without an incoming FK), and maintain_all()'s outer per-parent commit.
#
# It is much SMALLER than maintain_lock.sh's, and that is the point of tracing rather than probing.
# That guard needs MONO=6,000,000 so the regrain copy runs ~2.3 s -- a window wide enough for a
# reader probe to land inside repeatedly, because its unit of observation costs a whole lock_timeout.
# A trace has no such cost: the commit either falls between the two anchors or it does not.
#
# THE ANCHORS, both parent oids, never partition oids. retain DROPs the partition, so a partition's
# oid stops resolving the moment the thing under test succeeds; a parent's oid is stable, and it is
# what a reader of the table would actually block on.
#
# THE ASSERTION: between the LAST AccessExclusiveLock on mg_ret's parent and the FIRST lock of any
# mode on ml's parent, at least one TRANSACTION_COMMIT occurs in the same backend. That is the
# boundary vocabulary #265 and #279 are written in, and what #383 specified. A commit releases the
# lock, so this is the property.
#
# REQUESTS, NOT GRANTS (issue #393). bench/lock_probe.py attaches with attach_uprobe, which fires at
# function ENTRY, so every `kind: "lock"` record is a lock REQUEST, and the variables and labels below
# say so. The guard's conclusions are unaffected, and the argument is recorded here so the next reader
# does not have to re-derive it: under the request reading BOTH endpoints of the interval move
# earlier, but the interval contains exactly the SAME commits, because a backend cannot commit while
# it is blocked on a lock it has itself requested. A commit between mg_ret's request and its grant is
# impossible (the backend is waiting), and a commit between ml's request and its grant is likewise
# impossible -- and the request-based endpoint excludes that window anyway, so it cannot admit a
# spurious commit either. Neither a false pass nor a false fail is reachable through the distinction.
# On this fixture the two readings are microseconds apart regardless, it being single-backend and
# uncontended.
#
# Under CONTENTION the distinction is the whole signal: the distance between request and grant IS the
# wait. bench/lock_view.py adds an attach_uretprobe precisely so that span is observed rather than
# inferred, and shipping that beside a guard whose variables called a request a grant invited the
# misreading this repo keeps paying for.
#
# The RELEASE is deliberately not asserted, and not even probed. UnGrantLock and RemoveLocalLock take
# pointers to structs, so recovering a relation oid from them means reading fields at offsets that
# shift between PostgreSQL versions -- the fragility this instrument exists to avoid.
# LockRelationOid(Oid, LOCKMODE) passes scalars, which is why it is the one lock probe used here.
#
# maintain_obtain() runs BEFORE tracing starts, on purpose. It takes ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on ml's parent
# to create partitions, which would otherwise land in the traced stream ahead of mg_ret's sweep and
# make "ml's turn" look like it had already begun. The old pg-lock-tracer version excluded it with a
# query-boundary probe; not probing queries at all is simpler and needs no extra uprobe.
#
# THE LIVENESS WITNESSES matter more here than in any other guard in this directory. An ordering
# assertion is a claim about an interval, and over an EMPTY interval it is vacuously true. A tick
# with nothing to drop takes no strong lock, produces no anchor, and would sail through. So the guard
# asserts, before it asserts any ordering: the probe attached and is delivering; both anchors were
# found; NO events were dropped (the probe counts that itself, in the kernel, at the instant of the
# event); and pgpm.log shows the tick DID the work that takes the lock, by exact action name
# (retain_drop, regrain_copy -- never a prefix, since non-success events are prefixed skip_/fail_).
#
# Usage: lock_trace.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# The install path defaults to the real one; bench/discriminate.sh passes a MUTANT copy instead, to
# prove this guard actually fails when the defect is present.
