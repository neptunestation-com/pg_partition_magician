# Run tests/timescale/db/67_from_hypertable_cutover_waits_for_older_snapshots_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_hypertable/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant (issue #1241, the hypertable copy of
# regrain's swap).
#
# The file is plain pgTAP and the timescale track runs it already; this wrapper is the standing proof that its
# assertions DISCRIMINATE. The subject is a negative ("the cutover did not swap under the reader"), equally satisfied
# by a cutover that never had the swap in front of it, so the file pins its premises with liveness witnesses (the
# reader's snapshot predates the copy, the reader holds no lock on the hypertable, its chunks or the copy) and shows
# the same cutover swapping once the reader has committed. The cutover dropped the hypertable and renamed the copy
# into its place under a REPEATABLE READ reader whose snapshot predated the copy, and the reader then read the table
# empty; now it waits for that snapshot under p_lock_timeout first (pgpm._snapshot_wait), and refuses whole.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   hypertable_cutover_no_snapshot_wait -- the cutover waits for no snapshot before it swaps (parts A to D)
#   hypertable_drain_delete_unrecorded  -- a drain's pure delete is not recorded as the copy's last write, so a
#                                          reader between it and the swap reads the deleted row back (part C)
#
# Usage: hypertable_cutover_waits_for_older_snapshots.sh <container> <db> [pgpm_hypertable/install.sql]
# Runs on the TIMESCALE track's container (supabase/postgres + TimescaleDB), which is why its mutation sits in
# MUTATION_TRACK=timescale. That image does not trust the local socket, so every psql call goes over TCP (see
# run_timescale). run_timescale also runs it against the real install, so a harness broken enough to fail against
# everything cannot read as discriminating.
