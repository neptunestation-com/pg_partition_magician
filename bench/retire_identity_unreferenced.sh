# Run tests/103_retire_identity_unreferenced_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_core/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that its #428 assertions DISCRIMINATE. They are almost all negatives -- "the
# substitute was not dropped", "the partition pgpm meant is untouched", "the pgpm.part row stays" --
# and a negative is equally satisfied by a run that never set the substitution up, or by a table
# retire() could not have dropped anything on in the first place. The file pins both with liveness
# witnesses of its own (retiring_oid genuinely null so this is not #407's path, child_oid recorded,
# the substitute's different oid, and an untouched sibling that DOES retire in the same run), but
# nothing re-checks that those witnesses would fail if the guard they guard were removed.
#
# TWO mutations are required to fail against it, and they are not redundant -- each proves a
# different half of the file is load-bearing (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   retire_drop_child_oid_ignored      -- the check consults retiring_oid only, which is pre-#428
#                                         exactly. Breaks PART A; part B still passes.
#   retire_identity_coalesced_anchors  -- the plausible-but-wrong fix: coalesce(retiring_oid,
#                                         child_oid) instead of checking both. Part A still passes,
#                                         so only PART B catches it -- which is the whole reason
#                                         part B exists.
#
# Usage: retire_identity_unreferenced.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# Runs on the plain core image (it needs pgtap and pg_prove, both of which it has). No pg_cron is
# needed even though part B sets retiring_at/retiring_oid: the only cron call on the refusal path is
# pgpm._idle_detach_job, which swallows "no such schema" by design.
