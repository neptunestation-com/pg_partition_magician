#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its load-bearing assertions are negatives -- "the
# DISABLED trigger did not fire", "the ALWAYS trigger did not fall back to origin-only" -- and a
# negative is equally satisfied by a run in which the trigger state was never there to lose, which is
# the failure mode this repo has shipped six times. The file pins its setup with liveness witnesses of
# its own (the plain table really carries one trigger in each of the four states, and the two
# pre-conversion writes really produce 1001 and 11), but nothing re-checks that those witnesses would
# still fail if the state re-application they guard were removed. Pointing the same file at a mutant
# is what checks that, every CI run, instead of once by hand in a commit message.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   transmute_trigger_state_dropped    -- the cutover replays pg_get_triggerdef verbatim and never
#                                         re-applies tgenabled, which is pre-#499 behaviour exactly: a
#                                         DISABLED trigger fires on the next write, ALWAYS and REPLICA
#                                         become origin-only
#   untransmute_trigger_state_dropped  -- the same omission at the reversal, so the restored table
#                                         comes back with every trigger ENABLE
#
# Usage: cutover_trigger_state.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# Runs on the plain core image (it needs pgtap and pg_prove, both of which it has).
# CUTOVER_TRIGGER_TEST_FILE overrides the test file's path inside the container, for running from a
# worktree that is mounted somewhere other than /repo.
