# Run tests/129_set_regrain_off_midflight_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of pgpm_core/install.sql,
# so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it on
# every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the standing
# proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its load-bearing assertions are negatives -- "no child carries
# capture", "no copy is recorded", "TRUNCATE is not refused", "three later ticks did nothing" -- and a
# negative is equally satisfied by a run in which no regrain was ever in flight, which is the failure mode
# this repo has shipped six times. The file pins its setup with liveness witnesses of its own (capture
# really sat on the source, the cursor really was set, an update really landed in the delta, TRUNCATE
# really was refused), but nothing re-checks that those witnesses would still fail if the abandonment they
# guard were removed. Pointing the same file at a mutant is what checks that, every CI run, instead of
# once by hand in a commit message.
#
# The mutation it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   set_regrain_off_keeps_regrain  -- set_regrain(parent, null) writes regrain_to and nothing else again,
#                                     which is pre-#516 behaviour exactly: the run in flight is neither
#                                     driven (maintain dispatches only while regrain_to is set) nor swept
#                                     (the janitor keeps capture on the child covering the cursor, which
#                                     nothing clears), so capture, the TRUNCATE refusal, the delta and the
#                                     copies all stay, and tests/129's section (A) is what catches it
#
# Usage: set_regrain_off_midflight.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# Runs on the plain core image (it needs pgtap and pg_prove, both of which it has).
# SET_REGRAIN_OFF_TEST_FILE overrides the test file's path inside the container, for running from a
# worktree that is mounted somewhere other than /repo.
