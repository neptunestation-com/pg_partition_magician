#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that its #518 assertions DISCRIMINATE. The load-bearing ones in part A are negatives
# -- "the ledger row is still there", "no archive_coverage_reset was logged" -- and a negative is
# equally satisfied by a write-block pass that never resets anything, which is the failure mode this
# repo has shipped six times. The file pins that with liveness witnesses of its own (the recorded
# child_oid, the substitute's different oid, the trigger still on the real relation, the archive step
# reaching the ledger for the untouched sibling in the same tick) and with part B, where the reset
# is required to FIRE on a partition whose identity is intact; but nothing re-checks that those
# witnesses would fail if the guard they guard were removed. Pointing the same file at a mutant is
# what checks that, every CI run, instead of once by hand in a commit message.
#
# TWO mutations are required to fail against it, and neither is redundant -- each is a different
# plausible way to get this wrong:
#   coverage_reset_by_name                 -- the identity predicate computed and ignored, so "coverage
#                                             without its block" is decided by the name alone again.
#                                             Pre-#518 behaviour exactly. Breaks PART A.
#   coverage_reset_unanchored_is_mismatch  -- the tempting consistency fix: `is distinct from`, the
#                                             form retire() and _archive_step use, which reads a null
#                                             child_oid as a substitution and keeps, for every
#                                             partition an install upgraded with, coverage nothing
#                                             vouches for. Breaks PART C only.
