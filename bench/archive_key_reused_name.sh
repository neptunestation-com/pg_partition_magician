# Run tests/archive/db/34_archive_key_reused_name_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_archive/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. Test 34 is a plain pgTAP file and the archive track already runs it, so on
# correct code this script adds nothing. What it adds is the standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES.
# Its contract (issue #822) is that an object key is never reused by a different relation: a table that
# takes a dropped and forgotten table's name archives to a key of its own, and the old table's object, by
# then the only copy of the rows retire() dropped, is left as it was. A run in which the second table
# never archived, or archived to a key nobody had written, satisfies "the old object is intact" too. The
# file pins that with witnesses (each table's rows were retired, forget_missing() cleared the old one and
# its ledger, the new table archived its own row, every key was absent before its PUT) and with
# identities (each ledger row's exact key, each object's rows as id:payload, each Parquet file byte for
# byte), and pointing it at a mutant every CI run checks that those would fail.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py), one per site of the fix:
#   archive_object_key_reusable_name  -- archive._object_key ignores whose the name is, so the new table
#                                        keys its chunk <prefix><schema>.<table>_0 and PUTs over the old
#   archive_object_key_owner_unseeded -- install claims nothing from pgpm.archive_ledger, so a table that
#                                        archived before the claims existed owns no name
#
# Usage: archive_key_reused_name.sh <container> <db> [archive install.sql]
# Needs the archive image (pgsql-http + pgtap + pg_prove) AND MinIO on the same network: the file PUTs
# NDJSON and Parquet objects through maintain(). run_archive creates the bucket before any test runs;
# run_discriminate does not, so it is created here too, idempotently and the same way (a SigV4 PUT from
# the curl image; 200 is created, 409 is already there), after waiting for MinIO to report ready.
