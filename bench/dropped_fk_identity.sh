# Run tests/124_dropped_fk_identity_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of pgpm_core/install.sql, then
# exercise the one piece of #498 a pgTAP file cannot: the install-time backfill of a record an earlier
# pgpm captured, which needs install.sql run a SECOND time over a database that already has state.
# bench/discriminate.sh points both halves at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. tests/124 is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it on
# every version and channel, so the first half adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its contract assertions are negatives dressed as
# identities -- "the key is on the parent, not the monolith", "nothing references the decoy", "the
# orphan is refused" -- and every one of them is equally satisfied by a run in which the key was never
# restored at all, which is the failure mode this repo has shipped six times. The file pins its setup
# with liveness witnesses (the restore reported one key and logged exactly restore_incoming_fk, the
# forward partition the orphan routes to exists, the restoring session really has the default
# search_path), but nothing re-checks that those witnesses would fail if the anchoring they guard were
# removed. Pointing the same file at a mutant is what checks that, every CI run.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py), one per site of the fix:
#   dropped_fk_definition_session_search_path  -- the cutover captures pg_get_constraintdef() in the
#                                                 transmuting session again: unqualified when that
#                                                 session's search_path can see the parent, so the
#                                                 restore lands on whatever the name means THERE
#   dropped_fk_referencer_stays_on_monolith    -- the cutover no longer moves the records in which the
#                                                 converted table is the referencer onto its parent: a
#                                                 self-referential key (F5-02) and a key preserved against
#                                                 a table converted later (F5-07) both stay on the oid the
#                                                 rename turns into the monolith child
#   dropped_fk_definition_no_backfill          -- install.sql no longer rewrites a legacy unqualified
#                                                 record, which only the second half here can see
