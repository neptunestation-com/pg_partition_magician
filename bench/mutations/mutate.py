"""Reintroduce a known defect into pgpm_core/install.sql, so a guard can be shown to catch it.

A guard that passes proves nothing on its own: it might pass because the defect is gone, or because it
never observed anything. This repo has produced the second kind six times, so every guard under
bench/ has a mutation here that puts its defect back, and bench/discriminate.sh asserts the guard FAILS
against it. A guard that stays green on its own mutant is not a guard.

Each mutation states the exact number of sites it expects to change and REFUSES to write a mutant if
the count is off. That matters more than it looks: a mutation whose pattern has drifted out of date
would silently produce a clean copy of install.sql, the guard would pass against it, and
discriminate.sh would report "does not discriminate" for a guard that is in fact fine. Failing loudly
on a stale pattern is the same liveness-witness discipline the guards themselves follow.
