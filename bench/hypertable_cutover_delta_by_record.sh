# Run tests/timescale/db/65_from_hypertable_cutover_moved_delta_by_record_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_hypertable/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant (issue #1057, bullet 1).
#
# The file is plain pgTAP and the timescale track runs it already; this wrapper is the standing proof that
# its assertions DISCRIMINATE. The subject is how the drains and the cutover find a tracking copy's delta: by
# the oid pgpm.scratch recorded, wherever the delta lives now, as the capture trigger writes it. Confined to
# the hypertable's own schema, a delta moved with ALTER TABLE ... SET SCHEMA during the window read as no
# delta: the drains refused it, and the cutover ran the append-only catch-up for a tracking copy and left the
# moved delta and its capture function behind the records it deleted. And the swap drops the recorded capture
# function whether or not the delta is still there.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   hypertable_cutover_delta_in_hypertable_schema    -- the cutover counts the recorded delta only beside the hypertable
#   hypertable_drain_delta_in_hypertable_schema      -- so does from_hypertable_drain_delta
#   hypertable_drain_delta_step_in_hypertable_schema -- so does from_hypertable_drain_delta_step
#   hypertable_cutover_capture_fn_drop_tracking_only -- the swap drops the recorded function only when tracking
#
# Usage: hypertable_cutover_delta_by_record.sh <container> <db> [pgpm_hypertable/install.sql]
# Runs on the TIMESCALE track's container (supabase/postgres + TimescaleDB), which is why its mutations sit
# in MUTATION_TRACK=timescale. That image does not trust the local socket, so every psql call goes over TCP
# (see run_timescale). run_timescale also runs it against the real install, so a harness broken enough to
# fail against everything cannot read as discriminating.
