# Run tests/archive/db/16_to_s3_compress_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of pgpm_archive/install.sql,
# so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant, and then inflate the objects that test leaves
# behind with a gzip decoder this module does not have.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. Test 16 is a plain pgTAP file and the archive track already runs it, so
# on correct code the first half of this script adds nothing. What it adds is the standing proof that
# the file DISCRIMINATES: several of its assertions are negatives ("nothing at the plain key"), and a
# negative is also satisfied by an export that never happened. The file pins its setup with witnesses,
# but nothing re-checks that those witnesses would fail if the flag stopped being read. Pointing the
# same file at a mutant every CI run is what checks that.
#
# The second half is what the file cannot do from inside the database. The single-PUT object is one
# gzip member and the file checks its trailer (CRC-32 and length of the NDJSON) from SQL, but the
# multipart object is a CONCATENATION of members, one per text chunk, and only a decoder can say that
# the concatenation inflates to exactly the partition's rows. Python's zlib walks the stream one
# member at a time (so the member count is known), Python's gzip inflates it again as a second reader,
# and the rows are then compared by identity (every id, in order) and by digest against what the file
# recorded as expected. No python3 is a FAIL, not a skip: a reader that did not run verified nothing.
#
# The mutation it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   to_s3_compress_unread -- archive.to_s3 reads archive.config.compress as false again, the pre-#520
#                            shape exactly: plain NDJSON at <prefix><child>.ndjson whatever the flag
#                            says, and nothing at the documented <prefix><child>.ndjson.gz
#
# Usage: archive_to_s3_compress.sh <container> <db> [archive install.sql]
# Needs the archive image (pgsql-http + pgtap + pg_prove) AND MinIO on the same compose network: every
# export in the file is a real PUT. run_archive creates the bucket before any test runs;
# run_discriminate does not, so it is created here too, idempotently and the same way (a SigV4 PUT from
# the curl image; 200 is created, 409 is already there), after waiting for MinIO to report ready.
