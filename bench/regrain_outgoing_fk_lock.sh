# Guard regrain_step's swap against a scan-under-lock when the managed table has an outgoing
# foreign key (issue #348). Run by CI (`./test.sh perf`).
#
# THE BAR (issue #263's acceptance rule): a blocking lock may last milliseconds, but it must never
# last a duration coupled to data size.
#
# A fine child is created via `like ... including constraints`, which never copies a FOREIGN KEY
# (no LIKE option does). Before the fix, that leaves every fine child with no outgoing FK at all,
# so the swap's ATTACH PARTITION forces PostgreSQL to validate the parent's outgoing FK for that
# partition from scratch -- an O(rows) scan of the CHILD, inside the ATTACH statement, under
# whatever lock the swap already holds on the managed parent. Measured directly (not by this
# probe, which can only detect a block, not time one): at this guard's default (CHILD_ROWS=
# 8,000,000), attaching that partition with its FK pre-validated took ~20 ms; the identical
# attach without pre-validating took ~532 ms for the same row count -- and that gap is O(rows),
# so it grows without bound on a bigger partition, which is exactly how this reached a
# production statement_timeout.
#
# The fix (mirroring the bound CHECK, which already gets this treatment) adds each of the
# parent's outgoing FKs to the fine child, NOT VALID, then VALIDATEs it immediately -- while the
# child is still empty, so the scan costs nothing. By the swap's ATTACH, PostgreSQL adopts the
# already-validated constraint instead of re-scanning.
#
# The assertion is the consequence an operator sees: a plain INSERT into the MANAGED PARENT, with
# a lock_timeout shorter than the unfixed scan's duration but comfortably longer than the fixed
# swap's own duration, must never time out while a swap with an outgoing FK runs. At this guard's
# default (CHILD_ROWS=8,000,000), the probe itself measured 0 timeouts out of 342 write attempts
# against a fixed install and 10 out of 646 against an unfixed one -- the same gap the direct
# timing above shows, just observed as blocked writes instead of milliseconds.
#
# The fixture is built so the swap has exactly ONE non-trivial fine child: transmute's own step
# is twice regrain's target step, so the coarse monolith covers two sub-ranges, all CHILD_ROWS
# rows landing in the first and nothing in the second. That keeps the swap's cost concentrated in
# one ATTACH statement (one continuous lock hold) rather than spread thin across many small ones,
# which is easier for a probe polling on a commit-per-iteration cadence to actually catch.
#
# Usage: regrain_outgoing_fk_lock.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# The install path defaults to the real one; bench/discriminate.sh passes a MUTANT copy instead,
# to prove this guard actually fails when the defect is present.

# COMMIT after every attempt. Locks are held to transaction end and a DO block is ONE transaction, so
