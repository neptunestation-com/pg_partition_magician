#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its load-bearing assertions are negatives -- "no archive
# tick failed", "no regrain tick or janitor pass failed", "the twin's write block is not ours" -- and a
# negative is equally satisfied by a run that never reached the code it denies, which is the failure
# mode this repo has shipped six times. Here that risk is concrete rather than hypothetical: the defect
# (#512) only surfaced when a trigger row of exactly the right name met the cast, so a fixture with no
# same-named child under a trigger anywhere stayed quiet on the BROKEN code. The file pins that
# condition with witnesses of its own (the control archived and retired in the same ticks, a same-named
# child in a lower-case schema carried the capture trigger throughout, the twin really is blocked), but
# nothing re-checks that those witnesses would fail if the OID comparison they guard were undone.
# Pointing the same file at a mutant is what checks that, every CI run, instead of once by hand.
#
# The mutation it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   schema_name_regnamespace_cast -- _is_write_blocked and _regrain_capture_active select the parent's
#                                    schema by NAME and cast it back with `v_nsp::regnamespace`, which
#                                    is pre-#512 behaviour exactly: a schema that needs quoting
#                                    ("Sales") downcases, so the lookup raises (skip_archive every
#                                    tick, skip_regrain, skip_regrain_capture) or, once a lower-case
#                                    twin exists, answers for the twin's same-named child
#
