# Guard the DEFLATE encoders' memory cost on POORLY-COMPRESSIBLE input against #370: production
# hit `invalid memory alloc request size 1468780843` archiving a prompts."PromptRunLog" chunk at
# archive_byte_budget=256MB.
#
# THE BAR: encoding near-random input (few or no LZ77 matches, close to one token per output byte
# -- the worst case for token-count-scaled memory, and the shape Boardy's JSONB prompt/model-output
# blobs actually have) must cost roughly the size of the output, not scale with token count times a
# large constant. The old archive._pq_deflate_encode_dynamic kept six parallel int4[] arrays (one
# element per LZ77 token, retained for the whole call) plus a v_bytes int4[] appended one element
# per OUTPUT byte, hex-round-tripped at the end -- archive._pq_deflate_encode (the fixed-Huffman
# path, no current call site) carries the same v_bytes/hex-round-trip pattern. On a near-random
# payload, token count approaches payload size, so those arrays could reach Postgres's ~1GB
# single-allocation ceiling well before the raw payload did. Measured directly (this guard's own
# fixture, 15,000,000 bytes of near-random input): archive._pq_deflate_encode_dynamic peaked at
# 1,263,348-1,294,264 KB RSS pre-#370 vs 363,568 KB post-#370; archive._pq_deflate_encode
# (fixed-Huffman, no current call site, but carries the identical v_bytes/hex-round-trip pattern,
# just not the six token arrays) peaked at 533,604 KB pre-#370 vs 344,260 KB post-#370. Both
# functions are called directly (not the full to_parquet pipeline), isolating the encode step from
# #366's already-fixed LZ77 match-finding cost (bench/archive_lz77_memory.sh covers that one) and
# from #368's column-encode cost (bench/archive_encode_memory.sh). Directly re-running the exact
# incident scale (268,435,456 bytes, matching Boardy's archive_byte_budget=256MB) reproduces the
# original error verbatim on pre-#370 code ("invalid memory alloc request size 1085997440" at the
# same v_dist_sym[v_k] := ... assignment production hit) and succeeds post-#370 -- see issue #370
# for that evidence; this guard uses a much smaller fixture so CI stays fast.
#
# The payload is built via `string_agg(gen_random_bytes(1024), ''::bytea)` over generate_series --
# gen_random_bytes caps at 1024 bytes per call, so many small calls are aggregated into one bytea
# via a real aggregate (not a growing array), matching this repo's own array-growth doctrine.
#
# The unit of observation is SERVER-SIDE (docker exec cat /proc/<backend pid>/status) -- see
# bench/archive_lz77_memory.sh's note on ~100ms docker exec cost vs a narrow window; at this
# fixture size the encode call runs for several seconds, comfortably wider than a docker exec
# sample.
#
# Usage: archive_deflate_memory.sh <container> <db> [archive install.sql]
# The archive install path defaults to the real one; bench/discriminate.sh passes a MUTANT copy
# instead (with the old six-array + v_bytes int4[]/hex-round-trip pattern put back), to prove this
# guard actually fails when the defect is present.
