# Run tests/archive/db/16_encode_partition_tz_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_archive/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. Test 16 is a plain pgTAP file and the archive track already runs it, so
# on correct code this script adds nothing. What it adds is the standing proof that the file
# DISCRIMINATES. Its claim is an identity ("the object holds ids 1, 2 and 3") paired with witnesses
# that the grid's zone and the session's differ and that the two renderings of the chunk select
# different rows on the column; a fixture whose zones happened to agree, or a bucket still holding a
# good object from an earlier run, would satisfy the identity on broken code too. Pointing the same
# file at a mutant every CI run is what keeps that proof from decaying into a commit message.
#
# The mutation it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   archive_encode_no_partition_tz -- config.partition_tz dropped from all four pgpm._encode calls in
#                                     archive._encode_upload_ndjson_single and _encode_upload_parquet,
#                                     so the chunk's literals fall back to UTC wall time: pre-#501 exactly
#
# Usage: archive_encode_partition_tz.sh <container> <db> [archive install.sql]
# Needs the archive image (pgsql-http + pgtap + pg_prove) AND MinIO on the same compose network: both
# strategies PUT their object and the test fetches it back. run_archive creates the bucket before any
# test runs; run_discriminate does not, so the bucket is created here too, idempotently and the same
# way (a SigV4 PUT from the curl image; 200 is created, 409 is already there), after waiting for MinIO.
