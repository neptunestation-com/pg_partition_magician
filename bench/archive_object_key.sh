# Run tests/archive/db/16_archive_object_key_identity_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_archive/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. Test 16 is a plain pgTAP file and the archive track already runs it, so
# on correct code this script adds nothing. What it adds is the standing proof that the file
# DISCRIMINATES. Its central assertions are negatives ("the two ledger rows do not name one object")
# and identities ("the object at the [-10000, 0) key holds exactly ids -10000..-1"), each paired with a
# liveness witness that both partitions existed, held exactly the rows named, and were archived by the
# tick; but nothing re-checks that those assertions would go red if the stem went back to digits only.
# That was first seen by hand, once, against the pre-#502 code (the [-10000, 0) key holding the ten
# [10000, 20000) rows). Pointing the same file at a mutant every CI run keeps it from decaying into a
# commit message.
#
# The mutation it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   archive_object_key_digits_only -- archive._object_stem projects every native lo onto its digits
#                                     again, the id kind included, so chunk lo -10000 and chunk lo
#                                     10000 share one key and the second PUT of a tick overwrites the
#                                     first: the pre-#502 key exactly
#
# Usage: archive_object_key.sh <container> <db> [archive install.sql]
# Needs the archive image (pgsql-http + pgtap + pg_prove) AND MinIO on the same compose network: the
# file PUTs through both transports and fetches the objects back. run_archive creates the bucket before
# any test runs; run_discriminate does not, so the bucket is created here too, idempotently and the same
# way (a SigV4 PUT from the curl image; 200 is created, 409 is already there), after waiting for MinIO
# to report ready. PGPM_OBJECT_KEY_TEST_FILE overrides the test file's path inside the container, for
# running from a worktree that is mounted somewhere other than /repo.
