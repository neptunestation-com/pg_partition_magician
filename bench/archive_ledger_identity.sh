#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its assertions are negatives and bounded claims -- "no
# archive tick failed", "every fine child was retired within 40 ticks", "nothing is left under the old
# name" -- and every one of them is equally satisfied by a run in which no chunk was ever recorded
# before the regrain or the rename, which is exactly the setup tests/74 has and the reason it stayed
# green over this defect. The file pins its setup with liveness witnesses (a chunk really sits in the
# ledger under the old name, it really ends inside the data, the strategy really was handed that
# prefix), but nothing re-checks that those witnesses would fail if the mechanism they guard were
# removed. Pointing the same file at a mutant is what checks that, every CI run.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py), one per mechanism the fix
# for #511 added, so that a later refactor that quietly drops one of them is named:
#   archive_ledger_no_orphan_sweep     -- _archive_step no longer discards coverage recorded under a
#                                         name that is not a tracked partition; the pre-#511 rename
#                                         procedure wedges on archive_ledger_pkey again (case B)
#   regrain_swap_keeps_source_ledger   -- the swap drops the source but leaves its chunks in the ledger;
#                                         case A's post-swap assertions see them (the tick's own discard
#                                         then clears them, so the run still completes: only the direct
#                                         assertions name this mutant)
#   regrain_rename_orphans_ledger      -- the #266 transitional rename updates pgpm.part.child_name but
#                                         not the ledger, leaving the source's coverage under a name
#                                         nothing tracks, which the first fine child then takes (case D)
