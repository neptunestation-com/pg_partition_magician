#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it
# on every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the
# standing proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Nearly every assertion in it is a negative -- "the two
# sessions agree", "every hi equals the next lo", "no hole across the fall-back" -- and a negative is
# equally satisfied by a run that never set up the disagreement at all, which is the failure mode this
# repo has shipped six times. The file pins its setup with liveness witnesses of its own (the New York
# and UTC month boundaries really are different instants, the chosen day really has a fall-back, the
# second builder really extended the grid), but nothing re-checks that those witnesses would fail if
# the zone pinning they guard were removed. Pointing the same file at a mutant is what checks that,
# every CI run, instead of once by hand in a commit message.
#
# The mutation it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   grid_session_timezone  -- _grid_next's calendar step evaluated in the SESSION's TimeZone again, the
#                             zone parameter accepted and ignored, which is pre-#455 behaviour exactly:
#                             a grid transmuted under New York and extended under UTC lands on two
#                             lattices, and the hole between them is what tests/111 walks for
#
# Usage: grid_timezone.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# Runs on the plain core image (it needs pgtap and pg_prove, both of which it has). GRID_TZ_TEST_FILE
# overrides the test file's path inside the container, for running from a worktree that is mounted
# somewhere other than /repo, and is also how the other zone-class guards (bench/day_label_utc.sh and
# its siblings) drive THEIR pgTAP file through this same harness; GRID_TZ_LABEL names the property the
# PASS/FAIL line reports for that file.
