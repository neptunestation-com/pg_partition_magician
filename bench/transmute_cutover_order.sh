# Guard that phase 3's cutover builds and configures the new parent BEFORE either rename (issue #344),
# so that work never adds to the outage. #275's split already keeps the one O(rows) scan out from under
# ACCESS EXCLUSIVE; this is the sibling guard for phase 3 itself, which is one transaction end to end --
# anything it does after the first rename is held under that lock until the whole procedure commits.
#
# NOT a concurrency probe. The whole point of this change is to make the critical section SHORTER, which
# makes it harder, not easier, to catch anything "in progress" -- the opposite problem transmute_lock.sh
# solves. There is nothing to observe live; the property is about STATEMENT ORDER inside one transaction,
# which is simple, deterministic SQL against the installed function's own source text, with zero flake
# risk: no timing, no concurrent session, no polling loop to starve what it measures.
#
# Usage: transmute_cutover_order.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# The install path defaults to the real one; bench/discriminate.sh passes a MUTANT copy instead, to
# prove this guard actually fails when the defect is present.
