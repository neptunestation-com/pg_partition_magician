# Run tests/timescale/db/29_from_hypertable_index_names_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of
# pgpm_hypertable/install.sql, so bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant (issues #735 and #707).
#
# The file is plain pgTAP and the timescale track runs it already; this wrapper is the standing proof that
# its assertions DISCRIMINATE. Its subjects are the index pre-builds the copy and the cutover run (a name
# holding a space, a 63-byte key name) and the up-front refusal of a grid whose monolith name transmute
# would refuse after the swap. That refusal is of from_hypertable and from_hypertable_cutover, committing
# procedures, so it is wrapped by throws_like, and a procedure that wrongly does NOT refuse dies at its first
# COMMIT inside the wrapper with 2D000 and rolls back into the state a refusal leaves: the pinned message is
# the only thing that tells them apart, and pointing the file at a mutant is how that is known.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py), one per defect:
#   hypertable_index_ddl_by_pattern -- the pre-builds rewrite pg_get_indexdef by the space-delimited
#                                      pattern again (#735); part A fails
#   hypertable_tmp_name_cut         -- the temp names are cut to 63 bytes again (#707), in _from_hypertable_tmp_name
#                                      and in the key helper #872 added; part B fails
#   hypertable_handoff_unchecked    -- the monolith name is not asked for up front (#707); part C fails
#
# Usage: hypertable_index_names.sh <container> <db> [pgpm_hypertable/install.sql]
# Runs on the TIMESCALE track's container (supabase/postgres + TimescaleDB), which is why its mutations
# sit in MUTATION_TRACK=timescale. That image does not trust the local socket, so every psql call goes
# over TCP (see run_timescale). run_timescale also runs it against the real install, so a harness broken
# enough to fail against everything cannot read as discriminating.
