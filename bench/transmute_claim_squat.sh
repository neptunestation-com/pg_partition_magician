# Guard transmute's claim against an unprivileged squatter (issue #405). Run by CI (`./test.sh perf`).
#
# THE BAR: a role that can do nothing but CONNECT must not be able to stop pgpm from undoing an abandoned
# conversion. Before #405 it could. transmute claimed its table with a SESSION advisory lock keyed on
# hashtextextended('pgpm_transmute:' || oid), and both recovery paths -- pgpm._transmute_reap and
# pgpm.transmute_abort -- decided "is this conversion still running?" by trying to TAKE that same lock.
# Advisory locks carry no ACL and that key is public (the formula is in install.sql, the oid is in
# pg_class), so anyone could hold it. Grabbing it the instant a crashed conversion released it made the
# reaper read "still running" forever: the pgpm_monolith_bound CHECK left behind by the crash went on
# REJECTING every write outside [lo, hi) with no automated or manual way back, because transmute_abort
# consulted the very same lock and refused too.
#
# WHAT THIS DRIVES. A claim row whose owning session is genuinely gone (the state a died-mid-run
# conversion leaves), plus a SECOND session squatting the old advisory key, then:
#
#   1. pgpm._transmute_reap() must still undo the abandoned conversion.
#   2. pgpm.transmute_abort() must still work on a second, independently abandoned conversion.
#
# THE LIVENESS WITNESS, which is the whole reason this guard is not self-satisfying. "The reaper was not
# starved" is a negative, and a negative is equally satisfied by a run where the squat never happened at
# all -- a backgrounded session that died early, a key computed from the wrong oid, a psql that never
# connected. So this asserts, from a THIRD session and before touching the reaper, that the squatter is
# real: it holds an advisory lock, on the exact key the pre-#405 code used, and it is still connected.
# If that witness fails the guard fails, rather than reporting a clean bill of health for a squat that
# was never in place. (bench/discriminate.sh's transmute_claim_squat mutation restores the advisory-lock
# reaper and requires this guard to FAIL against it.)
#
# Usage: transmute_claim_squat.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# The install path defaults to the real one; bench/discriminate.sh passes a MUTANT copy instead, to
# prove this guard actually fails when the defect is present.
