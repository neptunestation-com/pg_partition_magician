# Run tests/129_retire_regrain_source_test.sql against an ARBITRARY copy of pgpm_core/install.sql, so
# bench/discriminate.sh can point it at a mutant.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. That file is a plain pgTAP file and the default matrix already runs it on
# every version and channel, so this script adds nothing on correct code. What it adds is the standing
# proof that the file DISCRIMINATES. Its assertions are negatives ("no not-attached row remains", "the
# cursor is cleared", "the regrain on the other child is untouched"), and a negative is equally satisfied
# by a run in which the regrain never copied anything before retire reached the source, which is the
# failure mode this repo has shipped six times. The file pins its setup with liveness witnesses of its
# own (the copies really were in flight at the drop, archiving really won, the regrain really never
# swapped), but nothing re-checks that those witnesses would fail if the reclamation they guard were
# removed. Pointing the same file at a mutant is what checks that, every CI run, instead of once by hand
# in a commit message.
#
# The mutations it is required to fail against (bench/mutations/mutate.py):
#   retire_drops_regrain_source        -- retire()'s call to _regrain_reclaim removed: pre-#519 exactly,
#                                         the source is dropped and the regrain's copies, cursor and
#                                         delta are left behind (tests/129 cases A and B)
#   retire_cancels_whole_parent_regrain -- the scoped reclaim replaced by pgpm.regrain_cancel(p_parent),
#                                         which is a superset: it also cancels a regrain in flight on a
#                                         DIFFERENT child of the same parent (tests/129 case C)
#
# Usage: retire_regrain_source.sh <container> <db> [install.sql]
# Runs on the plain core image (it needs pgtap and pg_prove, both of which it has). RRS_TEST_FILE
# overrides the test file's path inside the container, for running from a worktree that is mounted
# somewhere other than /repo.
