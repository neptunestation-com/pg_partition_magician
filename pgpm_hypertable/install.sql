-- =============================================================================
-- pg_partition_magician :: from_hypertable  --  migrate a TimescaleDB hypertable
-- to a pgpm-managed native RANGE partition set.
--
-- OPTIONAL add-on, loaded ON TOP of the core (pgpm_core/install.sql) and
-- ONLY in a database where the timescaledb extension exists. It is kept out of the
-- core install so pgpm's only runtime dependency stays pg_cron.
--
-- Strategy (see from_hypertable_design.md): un-hypertable by a full COPY into a
-- plain table under the original name, then hand to transmute -- version- and
-- catalog-agnostic, which is what the deprecated Apache builds need. The copy is
-- online (source serves traffic, committed per chunk); only the cutover takes a
-- brief lock. Scope: a single time/RANGE dimension on a timestamptz, timestamp or
-- date column, migrated ON that column (p_control must be the dimension; see
-- _from_hypertable_check_dimension for why); append-only catch-up at
-- cutover. The control column's key is whatever transmute reuses -- a PRIMARY KEY
-- or UNIQUE constraint that includes it, or keyless if it has neither (the common
-- hypertable shape). Identity columns are preserved (re-established before the
-- handoff, since CREATE TABLE LIKE does not carry identity), generated columns are
-- preserved (the copy omits them from its column list and they recompute on
-- insert), and CHECK constraints, defaults, and NOT NULL are carried onto the
-- partitioned parent by transmute. Refused up front: continuous aggregates, space
-- partitioning (>1 dimension), an integer-time dimension, and a p_control that is
-- not the dimension column; transmute also refuses a nullable control column, a
-- key that excludes it, or a bare unique index.
--
-- Catch-up has two modes. By default the cutover catches up append-only: rows
-- whose control column is past the copy watermark. That is enough for time-series
-- workloads that only ever append. For workloads that UPDATE or DELETE rows during
-- the online window, pass p_track_changes => true: the copy installs an AFTER
-- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE row trigger on the source that logs the touched key values
-- to a <rel>_pgpm_delta table, and the cutover reconciles every touched key against
-- the live source (delete-then-reinsert-from-source, which is idempotent and
-- order-independent, and subsumes the append-only catch-up). Reconciliation is by
-- the key transmute reuses (a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint), so tracking needs a
-- key: it is refused on a keyless table. The cutover auto-detects the apparatus (the
-- delta table) rather than taking a matching flag, so the two phases cannot disagree.
--
-- NAMING: a local ending in `_q` holds text whose identifiers are already quoted, so it is
-- spliced with `%s` and `%I` would be a bug. See the note at the top of pgpm_core/install.sql;
-- scripts/check_quoted_splices.py enforces it here too.

-- from_hypertable_disk_estimate: the approximate extra disk the online migration needs. The copy writes a
-- full second table (heap, and the indexes/identity rebuilt at cutover), so free roughly the source's
-- current on-disk size -- summed across all chunks (heap + indexes + toast) -- until the old hypertable is
-- dropped at cutover and the space is reclaimed. Callable on its own for sizing a volume ahead of time.

-- reads every chunk and writes a second heap, so the time is governed by data volume and effective
-- throughput, which is REGIME-dependent: a working set that fits in cache copies far faster than one that
-- is heap-random-I/O bound. p_copy_mibps overrides the assumed effective throughput (MiB/s of logical data
-- copied); when null it is chosen by comparing the estimated size to effective_cache_size. The defaults
-- (~40 MiB/s cache-resident, ~16 MiB/s disk-bound) are order-of-magnitude figures measured on a Supabase
-- 2XL on gp3 and scale with RAM/IOPS/throughput. This covers ONLY the copy -- the cutover's index rebuild
-- and an optional later regrain are additional. Callable on its own for sizing.

-- _from_hypertable_check_dimension: the two facts the chunk-by-chunk copy silently depends on (issue #458).
-- The copy bounds each chunk with `<p_control> >= range_start and < range_end` read from
-- timescaledb_information.chunks. Those are ranges OF THE DIMENSION COLUMN, and they are populated only for a
-- timestamp-typed dimension: an integer dimension's bounds live in range_start_integer and range_start is
-- NULL for every chunk. So the predicate partitions the table exactly when p_control IS the time dimension
-- AND the dimension is timestamptz/timestamp/date. Anything else copies a strict subset of the rows, or
-- nothing at all (`t >= NULL and t < NULL`), and the cutover then drops the hypertable and reports success
-- over an empty table: no error, no log row. Preflight used to check only that the column exists.
--
-- Factored out of the preflight so the cutover can run it in its own right. The cutover is the irreversible
-- step and required only that a destination exist, which a copy run under an older version (or a table made
-- by hand) satisfies without the copy phase ever having refused. dimension_number = 1 rather than
-- dimension_type = 'Time': Timescale allows a second range dimension, and then 'Time' names two rows while
-- the primary is always number 1 (preflight refuses >1 dimensions anyway). Internal, so no promise attaches.

-- Online delta drain (issue #170): reconcile the change-capture delta in bounded micro-batches WHILE the
-- source stays live, BEFORE the cutover takes its lock, so the locked window applies only a tiny residual
-- instead of the whole online-copy backlog. The reconcile is idempotent and order-independent per key (drop
-- the key's copied row from the dest, reinsert its current source row -- a deleted key stays absent, an
-- updated key gets its current value, an inserted key appears), which is exactly what makes incremental
-- draining safe: partial progress is always consistent, and any key can be reconciled more than once with no
-- effect. New writes keep appending to the delta during the drain; we chase the backlog down. The final
-- (tiny) residual is applied by the cutover under the brief lock, which is the correctness backstop.

-- from_hypertable_drain_delta_step does ONE micro-batch (no commit; the driver commits per batch). It
-- delete-RETURNS the batch's distinct keys from the delta as the authority and reconciles EXACTLY those keys
-- against the live source: a key the batch does not see (e.g. a write still in flight) is simply left in the
-- delta for the next batch or the under-lock final reconcile, so a change is never deleted-without-applying
-- (the read-then-delete race a two-snapshot approach would have). The batch is bounded by a pgpm_seq
-- watermark; the source read is bounded to the batch's control [min,max] as literal constants so TimescaleDB
-- excludes untouched chunks -- per-batch, even tighter than the one-shot reconcile (#166). Returns the number
-- of distinct keys reconciled this batch (0 = the delta is empty).

  -- RECORDED HERE, in the swap transaction, beside the drop (#563). The handoff below runs after this
  -- transaction commits and can still refuse (the monolith name a long table derives on a fine grid is
  -- over 63 bytes, a stray row fails its VALIDATE, ...), and the record used to wait in plpgsql locals
  -- until it returned: a refusal left the key gone from the referencing table and written nowhere. Now a
  -- key is gone only in a database where pgpm.dropped_fk says so, which is the rule transmute's own
  -- preserve path follows (#444). Recorded against the table this swap puts in place (v_dest_oid, renamed
  -- into the source's name below), the only relation there is to name: the parent does not exist until
  -- transmute's cutover, which carries every record naming the table it converts onto that parent. So the
  -- record follows the table through this handoff, or through the operator's own re-run after a refusal.
  --
  -- Deliberately NOT re-added here: doing so would leave an incoming FK in place when the plain table is
  -- handed to transmute, which refuses one by default, and asking for 'preserve' would just have transmute
  -- drop it again. The re-add happens after the handoff, through the core's dropped_fk machinery.
  -- The eligibility of these keys was settled in the preflight, before any copy work.
