[![pg_partition_magician: partition a live Postgres table online](docs/screenshot.png)](https://neptunestation-com.github.io/pg_partition_magician/)

Online RANGE partitioning for PostgreSQL, in **pure SQL**. No compiled extension, no superuser: install it
by running one file. The only runtime dependency is **pg_cron**, and only to run the background job.

It partitions on any **monotonic** key (time, integer/bigint ids including Snowflake, or **UUIDv7 / ULID**)
and manages the whole lifecycle:

- **`transmute`**: convert a live, unpartitioned table to partitioned **with no row movement**. The
  original is renamed aside and attached intact as one bounded **monolith** child, with a forward grid of
  real partitions laid down ahead of it. There is no `DEFAULT`: a write past that grid is refused, so the
  safety net is `obtain`'s lookahead, and `extend_to` for a write you know will land beyond it. The cutover
  is one read-only scan plus a metadata flip: no rebuild, no row rewrite, and **no lock that scales with row
  count** -- the scan runs under a lock that blocks neither readers nor writers
  (see [the guide](docs/guide.md#the-cutover-moves-no-rows)). What it does cost is a write ceiling for the
  scan's duration: writes outside the certified bound are rejected outright, not queued. Reversible with
  **`untransmute`** until the history outgrows the monolith.
- **`obtain`**: keep N partitions ahead of the write frontier. **`extend_to`**: pre-extend the grid past
  that lookahead to cover a known future value (an `id` grid that jumped ahead of the ceiling, say).
- **`regrain`**: split the monolith into fine partitions on demand, by **copying** (no dead tuples, no
  vacuum). Optional, a coarse monolith is a correct permanent state.
- **`retain`**: drop partitions past a policy. Set `config.archive_fn` to a resumable archive
  strategy -- e.g. archive to long-term storage, see the optional [`pgpm_archive`](#archiving-optional)
  add-on for ready-made ones -- and a partition only drops once it's fully archived, never before.
- **`maintain`** and **`maintain_obtain`**: the two procedures `pg_cron` calls, on two jobs that
  `pgpm.schedule()` creates together. `maintain_obtain` (the `pgpm_obtain` job) runs `obtain`; `maintain`
  runs everything else (archive, `retain`, optional auto-`regrain`) and never obtains, so scheduling
  `maintain` alone builds no forward partitions and writes past the grid start being refused.

The schema is `pgpm`. Think "a slice of `pg_partman`, installable as plain SQL."

Two caveats, both covered in the [guide](docs/guide.md). There is **no `DEFAULT` partition**: `obtain`
keeps a grid of real partitions ahead of the write frontier, and a write beyond that grid is *refused*
rather than parked somewhere. `config.obtain x partition_step` is therefore both your slack if maintenance
stalls and a ceiling on how far ahead you may write -- if you know a value is coming that jumps past it
(a sequence restart, a bulk import carrying its own ids), call `pgpm.extend_to(parent, value)` to build the
grid out to cover it ahead of time. And **incoming foreign keys** are preserved, not ignored (`transmute`
never rewrites your key; `p_incoming_fks => 'preserve'` re-adds each one once the table is quiescent).

## Why it exists

`pg_partman` is excellent, but it is a compiled C extension: it needs `CREATE EXTENSION`, the binary, and
privileges some managed or locked-down environments do not grant. `pg_partition_magician` is just tables,
views, and PL/pgSQL, so it installs anywhere you can run SQL and schedule a job.

## Modules

`pgpm_core` is the only required piece. Everything else is an independent, optional add-on that
loads on top of it (never before it); none of the add-ons depend on each other, and installing any
subset in any order is fine.

| Directory | What it's for | When you need it |
|---|---|---|
| **`pgpm_core`** | The product itself: `transmute`/`obtain`/`retain`/`regrain`/`maintain`. | Always. |
| **`pgpm_hypertable`** | A one-time [migration tool](#migrating-from-timescaledb) (`from_hypertable`) that converts a TimescaleDB hypertable to a pgpm-managed table, then hands off to `transmute`. Not something you keep using afterward. | Only if migrating off TimescaleDB (Apache edition). |
| **`pgpm_archive`** | Ready-made S3 [archive strategies](#archiving-optional) for `config.archive_fn` (see `retain` above). | Only if you want `retain` to archive a partition's data before dropping it; without it, `archive_fn` stays `null` and partitions just drop. |

## Install

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --single-transaction -f pgpm_core/install.sql
```

Re-running that file over an existing install is the supported upgrade path. Keep both flags: without
`ON_ERROR_STOP` psql reports an error and runs the rest of the file anyway, so an upgrade that refuses
("Nothing has been changed") goes on to change things and records the new version over a half-upgraded
install; `--single-transaction` makes the run all or nothing. `select pgpm.version()` reports what is
installed, and `pgpm.installed` records one row per install.sql run (with both flags, only a run that
completed without an error leaves one).

The [install page](https://neptunestation-com.github.io/pg_partition_magician/install.html) has dashboard
copy-paste bundles and the registry command; the [guide](docs/guide.md#install) covers all three channels
and uninstall. `pg_cron` must be enabled for scheduled maintenance.

## Quickstart

```sql
-- 1. Convert and register. Registers PAUSED: nothing moves until you resume.
call pgpm.transmute(
  p_parent   => 'public.events',
  p_control  => 'created_at',         -- the key to range-partition on (must be in the PK)
  p_interval => interval '1 month',
  p_obtain   => 7,                    -- keep 7 partitions ahead
  p_retain   => '90 days'             -- drop partitions older than this (null = keep)
);

-- 2. Schedule maintenance (one job covers every managed table; a second, independently paced,
--    keeps obtain from ever being delayed by a slow archive/retain/regrain):
select pgpm.schedule();

-- 3. Inspect, then go live:
select * from pgpm.status();
select pgpm.resume('public.events');

-- 4. (optional) Split the coarse history into fine partitions, paced across ticks:
select pgpm.set_regrain('public.events', '1 month');

-- 5. Watch it: when the monolith freezes, how far the regrain has got, and an ETA.
select * from pgpm.progress('public.events');
```

The two-step (transmute paused, then `resume`) lets you inspect before anything moves. `transmute` reuses a
primary key or unique constraint that includes the control column, or partitions keyless if neither exists;
the one hard requirement is a `NOT NULL` control column. See the
[walkthrough](docs/guide.md#transmute-a-table).

## Migrating from TimescaleDB

On a **TimescaleDB hypertable** (Apache edition)? `from_hypertable` migrates it to a pgpm-managed partition
set: an online copy into one plain table, done chunk by chunk (the source keeps serving traffic), then a
brief cutover that hands off to `transmute`. It preserves keys, indexes, identity, generated columns,
`CHECK`/defaults/`NOT NULL`, and translates a `drop_chunks` policy into pgpm `retain`. Keyed and keyless
hypertables both migrate.

```sql
call pgpm.from_hypertable('public.metrics', 'ts', interval '1 day');
```

For workloads that update or delete during the copy, pass `p_track_changes => true` (it reconciles by key, so
it needs one; keyless tables migrate append-only). Either way the catch-up backlog is drained **online before
the cutover**, so the lock applies only a tiny residual.

One keyless caveat: a translated `drop_chunks` retention reaches the migrated history all at once. `retain`
drops the monolith whole, in one step, once its entire range is past the horizon, and without a key the
history cannot be regrained into fine partitions that would age out one at a time.

It is an optional add-on, loaded only where the `timescaledb` extension exists:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f pgpm_hypertable/install.sql
```

See the [reference](docs/reference.md#migrating-from-timescaledb-from_hypertable) for the phases and knobs.

## Observability

pgpm logs every operation to `pgpm.log` but keeps no system-wide history. With
[`pg_flight_recorder`](https://github.com/dventimisupabase/pg_flight_recorder) (PGFR) installed,
`pgpm.impact_report` reports what the workload experienced during a conversion (checkpoints, WAL, waits,
latency).

```sql
select pgpm.impact_report('public.events');
```

Both ship with `pgpm_core`, read-only, and PGFR is **never a dependency**: they raise a clear error until
it's installed.

## Archiving (optional)

`retain` drops partitions past a policy, but data doesn't have to just disappear: the optional
`pgpm_archive` add-on supplies ready-made archive strategies (NDJSON and Parquet, to S3 or any
S3-compatible store, optionally GZIP-compressed) for `config.archive_fn`. Set it once (after the
one-time connection setup covered in [`pgpm_archive/README.md`](pgpm_archive/README.md)), and a
partition only drops once it's been fully archived -- automatically, in bounded chunks, ahead of
every drop:

```sql
select pgpm.set_archive_fn('public.events', 'pgpm.archive_to_s3_parquet(regclass,name,text,text)'::regprocedure);
```

Load it on top of the core:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f pgpm_archive/install.sql
```

See [`pgpm_archive/README.md`](pgpm_archive/README.md) for the full picture: connection setup,
choosing NDJSON vs. Parquet, and the synchronous alternative (`archive.to_s3`/`archive.to_s3_parquet`)
for manual, one-off archiving instead of the automatic `archive_fn` path.

## Tests

```bash
./test.sh        # full matrix: PG 15-18 x all install channels
./test.sh 15     # one version, all channels
./test.sh ci     # every track CI runs, including the ones the matrix skips
```

pgTAP on Docker. `./test.sh` covers the four PostgreSQL versions but skips the `timescale`, `observe`,
`archive`, `perf` and `discriminate` tracks, which need their own image or service, so it does not by
itself predict a green CI. Use `./test.sh ci` before pushing anything that touches
`pgpm_core/install.sql`. See [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md) for the dev loop.
