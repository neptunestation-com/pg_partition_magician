-- archive.to_s3_parquet took its child as a bare name and cast it to regclass, so the name resolved
-- through the CALLER's search_path rather than in the parent's schema (issue #464). From a session
-- whose search_path did not reach a managed table's schema, the real child was refused with
-- `relation does not exist`; and once any relation of the same name existed in public, that
-- relation's rows went out under the partition's key, with HTTP 200 and no error. archive.to_s3
-- resolved `%I.%I` from the parent's namespace and was right about the schema, but neither function
-- compared what the name resolved to against the oid pgpm.part recorded for the partition, which
-- the automatic path has done before every read of a child since #421 (fail_archive_identity in
-- pgpm._archive_step).
--
-- Both now resolve p_child in the parent's schema (archive._resolve_child) and refuse, with a
-- `pg_partition_magician:` error naming both oids, a relation that has taken a partition's name.
-- The fixture is the issue's own: a managed table in schema app, a session whose search_path is the
-- default `"$user", public`, and a same-named decoy in public with rows of its own. Every negative
-- is paired with a witness that the condition it denies was present: the decoy exists, differs from
-- the real child, and is what the bare name resolves to from this session; the object's key is
-- cleared and witnessed absent before each export, because the bucket outlives a test database and a
