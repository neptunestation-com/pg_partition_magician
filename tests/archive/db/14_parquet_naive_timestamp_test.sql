-- How the Parquet writer represents a `timestamp` (without time zone) column (issue #465).
--
-- A timestamptz is an instant and encodes the same in every session. A `timestamp` is a wall clock
-- with no instant of its own, and the writer used to push it through `::timestamptz`, which reads
-- the wall clock in the SESSION zone: the same partition archived by the pg_cron worker (cluster
-- default zone) and by an operator's `call pgpm.maintain()` from a differently-zoned psql carried
-- different instants for the same rows, while the NDJSON path (row_to_json) preserved the wall
-- clock either way. The writer now encodes the wall clock read as if it were UTC, Parquet's
-- representation of a naive timestamp, and annotates the leaf LogicalType
-- TIMESTAMP(isAdjustedToUTC=false, MICROS) beside the legacy TIMESTAMP_MICROS ConvertedType, the
-- pair pyarrow itself writes for a naive timestamp. Readers that know logical types give the wall
-- clock back as a naive timestamp; older ones see TIMESTAMP_MICROS and show it labelled UTC.
--
-- Two negatives live here ("the zone did not leak into the bytes", "the leaf is not the UTC-adjusted
-- one"), and each is paired with a witness that the condition it denies was present: the two sessions
-- really ran in different zones (read back from current_setting, not assumed from the SET), and the
-- session-zone cast the old writer used really does move these wall clocks, by two DIFFERENT offsets
-- (EST and EDT), so a compensating error cannot make the two files agree by accident. The encoded
-- values are asserted by identity against hand-computed microsecond epochs, never against each other.
-- The independent-reader half (pyarrow and DuckDB decoding the wall clock) lives in
-- scripts/verify_parquet.py, which pgTAP cannot reach.
