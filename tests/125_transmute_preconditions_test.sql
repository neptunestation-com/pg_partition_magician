-- transmute's preconditions on the TABLE and on the NAMES it will need, and the claim's view of its own
-- session (issue #509). Three defects, one shape: a condition the cutover was always going to trip on
-- was checked nowhere before it, so phases 1 and 2 committed a validated, write-rejecting
-- pgpm_monolith_bound CHECK plus a transmute_inflight claim, and the failure surfaced as a raw error from
-- inside the cutover, on a table the docs promised would be "untouched" by an up-front refusal.
--
--   A. transmute never asked whether p_parent was an unconverted plain table. Re-run on an already
--      converted table (the documented remedy after ANY failure, and what a client that lost its
--      connection after the cutover committed will do), phase 1 added the bound to the live PARTITIONED
--      parent, where it propagates to every partition including the forward ones taking writes; phase 2
--      validated it; the cutover then failed on the monolith's name, and the bound stayed, rejecting
--      every write past the original monolith's hi, i.e. every current write.
--   B. The orphan guard matched standalone TABLES named <rel>_p<digits>(_<digits>)* only. The monolith's
--      own coarse name <rel>_p<lo>_to_<hi> matched neither regex, so a relation holding it surfaced as a
--      42P07 from the cutover's RENAME with the bound and the claim left behind. A sequence, view or
--      index holding a CHILD name was skipped by the guard's relkind filter and then by obtain itself
--      (`continue when to_regclass(...) is not null`), so that conversion COMPLETED with no forward
--      partition and nothing logged: the first write past hi failed with `no partition of relation ...
--      found for row`, and every later tick skipped the name again.
--   C. The claim's take-over predicate was `not _session_alive(owner)`, and the owner of a claim left by a
--      cutover failure is the still-connected operator's own session, which reads as alive. So the
--      documented remedies, "re-run transmute, it resumes" and transmute_abort, were BOTH refused with
--      "already in progress in another session" to the very session that owned it, and the bound stayed
--      until that session disconnected, which no document said.
--
-- INSTRUMENT. The failing conversions run through dblink, for two reasons that both matter here. A
-- committing procedure inside throws_ok dies at its first COMMIT with 2D000 (tests/83's header), and
-- pg_prove runs this file under ON_ERROR_STOP, so a failing top-level CALL would end it. More to the
-- point, a mutant that fails LATE, in the cutover, must be allowed to really commit phases 1 and 2, so
-- that the damage each refusal exists to prevent (the bound on the live parent, the claim, the
-- 42P07) is observable and the state assertions below discriminate, instead of being satisfied by the
-- wrapper's own rollback. Part C keeps ONE dblink connection ('op') open across the failure, the retry
-- and the abort: that connection is one backend, so "the same session" is literal, and the second
-- connection ('holder') supplies the cutover failure deterministically (an open transaction holding
-- ACCESS SHARE on the referencing table, which the preserve-FK drop's ACCESS EXCLUSIVE waits behind
-- until p_lock_timeout), the shape tests/112 B already uses, with no poll and no race.
--
-- WITNESSES. Every refusal is paired with proof the condition it denies was present (the table really is
-- converted, the name really is the one the conversion needs, the claim's owner really reads as alive
-- and really is the op backend), and with a liveness witness that the same call succeeds once the
-- condition is removed, so a transmute that refused everything could not pass this file. Part C also
-- pins that the fix is scoped to the owner: a DIFFERENT live session is still refused both ways.
