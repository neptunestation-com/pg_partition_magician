-- regrain_step's swap must reconcile EVERY captured change before it drops the source (issue #447).
--
-- THE DEFECT. After the DETACH, the swap drained the change-capture delta with a loop bounded at 100
-- passes of greatest(batch, 1000) keys, then attached the fine children, dropped the source and truncated
-- the delta, with nothing checking that the loop had stopped because the delta was empty. The comment
-- said the DETACH guaranteed termination, which is true of the writer, not of the loop. The pre-swap gate
-- bounds only what had committed before it ran: a writer that already holds a row in the source keeps the
-- DETACH waiting for its ROW EXCLUSIVE, and everything it commits during that wait lands in the delta
-- AFTER the gate. Under maintain the DETACH has a 200 ms lock_timeout, so the exposure is a writer
-- committing more than 100 * batch changes inside that window; under an operator-driven regrain_step
-- there is no timeout, and a large history purge committing during the wait is exactly this shape.
--
-- THE PROBE. Two sessions, ordered by lock state rather than by sleeps. The writer (a dblink session)
-- inserts one row into the source and holds its transaction open: that is the lock the swap's DETACH
-- must wait for. This session then runs the swap tick, which passes the gate (the writer's row is
-- uncommitted, so the delta reads empty) and blocks on the DETACH. The writer polls pg_locks until it
-- sees that ungranted ACCESS EXCLUSIVE, records the observation, and only then commits 120,001 more
-- captured changes on top of its sentinel: 120,000 inserts, then one DELETE of an already-copied row,
-- LAST, so it carries the highest pgpm_seq and is the first thing a bounded drain leaves behind. The
-- swap then proceeds with 120,002 captured keys against a batch of 1000: 121 passes, 21 past the bound.
--
-- Every negative below ("no late row is missing", "the deleted row is not resurrected") is paired with
-- a witness that the condition it denies was present: the writer's recorded observation of the swap's
-- ungranted lock, and the reconcile log showing more than 100 passes at the swap whose consumed-row
-- total equals what was captured. bench/regrain_swap_reconcile.sh drives this file against a mutant
-- with the bound put back, and `./test.sh discriminate` requires it to FAIL there.
