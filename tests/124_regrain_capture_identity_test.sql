-- regrain's change capture is anchored by IDENTITY, re-minted per regrain, and writable by the parent's
-- writers (issue #496).
--
-- Three defects, one root cause: the capture apparatus (the per-parent delta table and the trigger
-- function the source child's trigger drives) was found by NAME, derived from the parent's CURRENT
-- relname, and kept across regrains once minted. (1) A rename of the parent mid-regrain left the trigger
-- writing the delta it was given while reconcile, the swap gate and the swap all derived a new name, found
-- nothing, counted 0 pending and swapped: every change committed since the copy went with the source. (2)
-- The delta kept the key columns of the FIRST regrain while the trigger function was regenerated from the
-- CURRENT key, so a key column renamed between two regrains made every write into the source raise for the
-- life of the next one. (3) The delta was created by whoever ran regrain_step, with no grants, and the
-- trigger ran as the writer, so every non-owner role with DML on the parent got 42501 on every write into
-- the regraining child. (Since #1073 the capture function is SECURITY DEFINER and writes the delta as its
-- owner, the parent's, so a writer needs no grant on the delta at all; the grants below are still made and
-- re-synced, and section (C) checks them by the grant state.)
--
-- The fix records the delta's and the function's oids in pgpm.config at prepare and resolves them from
-- there (falling back to the derived name only when nothing is recorded); drops and re-mints the delta on
-- every prepare, from the key as it is now; and gives the delta the parent's owner plus INSERT for every
-- role holding INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE on the parent, re-synced on every tick.
--
-- Every negative below ("the change is honoured", "the write does not raise") is paired with a witness
-- that the condition it denies was present: the derived name really changed, the delta really was minted
-- with the old key, the role really had no privilege on a delta nobody had granted.
-- bench/regrain_capture_identity.sh runs this file against mutants that put each defect back
-- (regrain_capture_by_name, regrain_delta_reused, regrain_delta_ungranted), so it is also required to
-- FAIL there.
