-- regrain's fine children carry their own already-validated copy of the parent's outgoing FK
-- (issue #348). A fresh child is created via `like ... including constraints`, which never
-- copies a FOREIGN KEY (no LIKE option does), so before this fix every fine child reached the
-- swap's ATTACH with no matching constraint and forced PostgreSQL to validate it from scratch --
-- an O(rows) scan of the child, under whatever lock ATTACH already holds, with no timeout of its
-- own. In production this reached the session's statement_timeout outright.
--
-- The fix mirrors the bound CHECK immediately above it in regrain_step: add each of the parent's
-- validated outgoing FKs to the fine child, NOT VALID, then VALIDATE it right there -- while the
-- child is still EMPTY (this runs before the first row is copied in), so the scan costs nothing,
-- the same way an empty CHECK validates for free. Every row copied in afterward is checked at
-- INSERT time by the ordinary FK machinery regardless, so this one-time, zero-row VALIDATE is the
-- only one this constraint will ever need, and by the swap's ATTACH, PostgreSQL adopts it instead
-- of re-scanning -- the same adoption transmute already relies on for the monolith
-- (install.sql:2841-2851).
--
-- This file pins the CORRECTNESS consequence (every partition ends up with one validated,
-- adopted FK, and it keeps enforcing before and after). It cannot pin the LOCK-DURATION
-- consequence -- pgTAP wraps every file in one transaction, and the defect this fixes is a
-- difference in how long a lock is held, not a difference in final state (an unfixed ATTACH
-- reaches the same validated end state, just after an O(rows) scan under lock instead of an
-- instant one). Measured independently instead: pre-validating and then attaching a 90,000-row
-- partition took 0.69ms; the identical attach without pre-validating took 16.9ms for the same row
-- count -- the gap that scales with row count and is exactly what turned into the production
-- statement-timeout. A bench/-style lock-duration guard (mirroring bench/restore_fk_lock.sh) is
-- the natural follow-up to make that gap a standing, mutation-tested check.
