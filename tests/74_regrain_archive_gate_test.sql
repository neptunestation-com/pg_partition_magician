-- regrain must not destroy aged rows that the archive gate is protecting (issue #278).
--
-- retire refuses to drop a partition until archiving has fully covered it, which is the guarantee the
-- README states as "a partition only drops once it's fully archived, never before". regrain used to
-- discard aged sub-ranges with the source at the swap, never materializing them, so with archive_fn set
-- it destroyed exactly the rows that gate was holding back, unarchived.
--
-- The skip's own comment justified itself with "they would be dropped by retain() the instant they became
-- partitions". That stopped being true at #238, when retire gained the coverage gate.
--
-- The fix is to stop skipping when archive_fn is set: the aged sub-range becomes an ordinary fine child,
-- and the existing pipeline (write-block, then archive, then retire) takes it from there, already gated.
-- With no archive_fn the cheap skip is unchanged, because retire's gate is a no-op with nothing to cover.
