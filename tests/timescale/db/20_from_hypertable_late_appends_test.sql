-- The append-only catch-up dropped rows that arrived with control at or below the watermark (issue #460).
--
-- Without p_track_changes the cutover catches up rows whose control value is past the copy watermark
-- (max control in the destination). Two shapes of row arriving during the online window were therefore
-- lost with no error and no log row: a row whose control value is BELOW the watermark (out-of-order
-- appends: multi-writer clock skew, batched device uploads, backfills -- the normal IoT shape), and a
-- row EXACTLY AT it, which a strict `>` excludes. Nothing under the lock compared the two sides, so the
-- source was dropped short.
--
-- Three layers, cheapest first, each pinned here:
--   * on a KEYED table the under-lock catch-up now takes `>=` the watermark with a key anti-join
--     against the destination, so the equality edge is never a loss and the copied row already at the
--     watermark is not duplicated (part A: the cutover SUCCEEDS with both late rows present by identity);
--   * under the lock, before anything is dropped, the source's count(*) is compared with the destination's
--     and the swap is REFUSED on a mismatch, naming both counts (part B: a keyed table with one row
--     behind the watermark; part C: a keyless table, where equality is detected rather than repaired);
--   * the reference states the late-arrival caveat and recommends p_track_changes for a keyed table.
--
-- WHAT THE HARNESS ALLOWS, same constraint as tests/timescale/db/17: run_timescale fails the track on any
-- `ERROR:` line, so a refusing cutover must be wrapped by throws_like, and a procedure that reaches its own
-- COMMIT inside a function raises `invalid transaction termination`. A cutover that WRONGLY proceeds to
-- the swap therefore cannot be observed committing: it dies at its commit and rolls back into the same
-- end state as a correct refusal. The discriminator is the refusal's message with BOTH COUNTS in it; the
-- state assertions after it are invariants and are marked so. p_predrain => false in those parts so no
-- per-batch COMMIT is reached inside throws_like (the residual here is one row, so the pre-drain would do
-- nothing anyway).
--
-- LIVENESS: every part records the watermark BEFORE inserting the late rows and asserts each row's
-- relation to it (behind, exactly at, 1 us past) and that none of them is in the destination, so a
-- pass cannot come from rows that were simply copied in the first place. Fixtures are asymmetric on
-- purpose: 3 rows in, 1 or 2 of them invisible to the catch-up, never a shape where errors cancel.
select plan(32);

-- Keyed and keyless hypertables whose data ends BEFORE now() (headroom), so the late rows can sit in the
-- recent past above, at and below the copy watermark and still at/under now(). Same reasoning as test 15.
-- UNIQUE (device_id, ts) with device_id = g keeps the pair unique; late rows use device_id >= 9001.
