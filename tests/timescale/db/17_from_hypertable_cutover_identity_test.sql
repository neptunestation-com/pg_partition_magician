-- from_hypertable_cutover locked a name and then DROPped it, without verifying the oid (issue #422).
--
-- The cutover resolves p_hypertable to a name pair once, near the top, then does a substantial amount
-- of work before locking anything, and only then `lock table <nsp>.<rel> in access exclusive mode`,
-- `drop table <nsp>.<rel>`, and `alter table <dest> rename to <rel>`. LOCK TABLE locks whatever the
-- name meant at lock time; nothing re-resolved it afterwards and compared it to p_hypertable.
--
-- WHICH WINDOW ACTUALLY MATTERS, because most of the span is self-protecting:
--
--   * A rename landing before the cutover starts is caught by the `found no copy to cut over` check:
--     the staging names derive from the source's name, so they stop resolving.
--   * A rename landing during the online pre-drain is caught too, but by a mechanism the issue did
--     not name: from_hypertable_drain_delta_step / _drain_appends_step each RE-RESOLVE the name per
--     batch, so the next batch raises `found no delta`. The pre-drain commits per batch and so looks
--     like the widest part of the window; it is in fact the safest.
--   * That leaves the index pre-builds -- explicitly the O(rows) work the cutover moved OUT of the
--     lock to keep the outage brief, so the LONGEST stretch of the window -- with nothing in it that
--     re-resolves the source. This file exercises exactly that stretch.
--
-- THE LEVER IS AN EVENT TRIGGER, NOT A RACE. The substitution has to land between the name resolution
-- and the lock, which is inside one procedure call; a second session timed to hit it would be exactly
-- the poll-then-race probe this project has been bitten by. An event trigger on CREATE INDEX fires
-- deterministically in that window, because the index pre-builds are what is running there.
--
-- WHAT THE HARNESS ALLOWS, and why the assertions look the way they do. run_timescale fails the track
-- on any `ERROR:` line, so the cutover must be wrapped by throws_like -- and a procedure that reaches
-- its own COMMIT inside a function raises `invalid transaction termination`. So a run that WRONGLY
-- succeeds cannot be observed committing: it dies at its commit and rolls back, landing in the same
-- end state as a correct refusal. The discriminating assertion is therefore the refusal's own message,
-- matched exactly; the state assertions after it are invariants, not discriminators, and are marked so.
-- The one thing that must survive the rollback is proof the lever fired at all, so that is witnessed
-- through a SEQUENCE, whose nextval is non-transactional.

-- recording #422 describes and this change deliberately does not do.
