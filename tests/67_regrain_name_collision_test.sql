-- regrain must never name a fine sub-range the same as the source child it is splitting (issue #266).
--
-- pgpm._part_name gives a one-step range the historical name _p<lo> and a WIDER range the explicit
-- _p<lo>_to_<hi>, and the comment above it states the reason: the wide form exists "so it can never
-- collide with the fine child at its low edge". The flaw is that "wider" was judged at the child's OWN
-- step. A child exactly one step wide is not wide on its own grid, so it kept the bare _p<lo>; regrain
-- then reinterprets it on a FINER grid, where its own first sub-range also renders _p<lo>.
--
-- Unguarded that was silent data loss: regrain_step's "does the destination exist yet?" check found the
-- SOURCE, treated it as an already-created destination, the anti-join copy moved nothing, the cursor
-- advanced as though the sub-range were done, and the swap's DROP TABLE took those rows with it.
--
-- The cure is to finish the stated design: before splitting, rename the source to its own name as
-- rendered on the TARGET grid, where it IS wider than one step and therefore always takes the explicit
-- _to_ form. The fine sub-range names are then free, and the collision is structurally impossible.
