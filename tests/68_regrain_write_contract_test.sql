-- The WRITE side of regrain's copy contract (issue #267).
--
-- tests/48_regrain_copy_contract_test.sql already pins the three properties the copy model was ADOPTED
-- for, and all three are read-side: a plain read of the parent never undercounts mid-regrain, the source
-- is never deleted from, and snapshot() does not double-count the in-flight copies. Nobody wrote the
-- other half, and there the copy model is simply wrong.
--
-- regrain_step's copy is resume-safe three ways -- a `>= max(dest.ctl)` high-water bound, a `not exists`
-- anti-join on the reused key, and a cursor that advances past a completed sub-range and never returns.
-- None of the three is a RECONCILE: the copy only ever ADDS rows and only ever moves FORWARD. The swap
-- then drops the source, so the copy becomes the authority for everything that changed after it ran.
--
-- The contract these tests assert, which any correct implementation must satisfy however it is built:
--   COMMITTED DML AGAINST THE SOURCE, MADE WHILE A REGRAIN IS IN FLIGHT, SURVIVES THE SWAP.
--
-- Each case drives regrain_step tick by tick, which is how maintain feathers it, and interleaves the DML
-- BETWEEN ticks. It deliberately does not use pgpm.regrain(): that driver loops in one transaction, so
-- nothing can interleave inside it and it would mask every defect here.
--
-- Fixtures are sparse (ids 10,20,...,2500) so there are free slots inside an already-copied sub-range,
-- and the monolith is COARSE ([0,3000), three grid steps) so #266 does not confound the result.
