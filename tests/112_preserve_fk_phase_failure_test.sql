-- A preserve-managed incoming FK survives a conversion that fails after phase 1 (issue #444).
--
-- transmute runs in three transactions (#275): add the monolith bound, validate it, cut over. Under
-- p_incoming_fks => 'preserve' the incoming FK used to be DROPPED in the first of them, before the claim
-- and phase 1's commit, while the pgpm.dropped_fk row that lets restore_incoming_fks re-add it was
-- written only in the cutover. A phase 2 or 3 failure therefore lost the key with no record of it:
-- transmute_abort put the CHECK back and logged "table restored", the referencing table accepted
-- orphans, and a clean re-run had nothing left to restore. Measured on PG 17.11 against a72c5bf.
--
-- The fix moves the drop INTO the cutover, into the same transaction as the record. So the contract
-- pinned here is: a failure in phase 1 or 2 leaves the key exactly where it was (nothing dropped,
-- nothing recorded), a failure in the cutover rolls the drop back with everything else, and only a
-- completed conversion has a key to restore.
--
-- INSTRUMENT. The phase 2 failure is only reachable when the CALL runs at the top level of a session:
-- a committing procedure inside throws_ok dies at phase 1's COMMIT with 2D000 and never gets there
-- (tests/83's header), and pg_prove runs this file under ON_ERROR_STOP, so a failing top-level CALL
-- would end it. The failing conversions therefore run in a second session through dblink (as tests/60
-- and 77 already do for their second sessions): dblink_exec re-raises the remote error with its own
-- SQLSTATE and primary message, which throws_ok then pins exactly. That backend's exit is asynchronous
-- once its connection closes, so rather than poll pg_stat_activity for it (a timing race), the claim's
-- owner is cleared before the abort and the re-run, tests/101's stand-in for a session that has ended.
--
-- WITNESSES. Every "the key is still there" below is paired with proof that the conversion got as far
-- as claimed (the bound CHECK is on the table, NOT VALID after a phase 2 failure and VALIDATED after a
-- cutover failure), and the completed re-run must actually drop and record the key before restore
-- brings it back, so a preserve path that had quietly become a no-op could not pass this file.

-- phase2_stray(rel, row_sql, call_sql, tz): make call_sql fail in phase 2 on a stray row, deterministically
-- (#668). transmute now reads the table's maximum and refuses or covers a future-dated row before phase 1,
-- so a stray already in the table no longer reaches VALIDATE. One that is committed AFTER that read does:
-- session pw inserts row_sql and holds it uncommitted (its ROW EXCLUSIVE lock blocks phase 1's ADD), session
-- pa starts call_sql, which reads the maximum without seeing the row and then waits on phase 1's ACCESS
-- EXCLUSIVE; once pa is seen waiting, pw commits, the ADD ... NOT VALID proceeds without checking existing
-- rows, and phase 2's VALIDATE finds the row. Returns whether pa was seen waiting when pw committed (the
-- ordering witness: nothing of phase 1 had run yet, so VALIDATE could only come after the commit) and the
-- error pa's CALL ended with. The poll reads pg_locks only, which takes no lock on the table.

-- ============================ B. the cutover fails; the drop rolls back with it ============================
-- A second session holds an open transaction that has read the REFERENCING table. That touches nothing
-- in phases 1 or 2, which only take locks on the table being converted, and blocks exactly one thing in
-- the cutover: the ACCESS EXCLUSIVE the FK drop needs on the referencing table. With a short
-- p_lock_timeout the cutover gives up there, and the claim is that nothing of it survives.
--
-- The conversion's own session gets a 2 s session-level lock_timeout through the connection string.
-- The phases override it with their own, so it changes nothing here; it exists so that a regression
-- putting the drop back before the claim, where no phase timeout covers it, fails this file loudly
-- instead of hanging it on the holder's lock.
